dim stars in the same sky bats hiding
hidden in one palm hundreds of bats at the oasis
last light of day into the clearing curves the first bat
dipped in dark bats streak twilight skies
flying with him red spots on the shoulders of the black bird
an old yellow cat paws tucked under her chest waiting for a mouse-moon
the cicada's cry leaves in the maples brittle gold
cicadas as if they'd won a poetry contest
red-eyed cicada wet from molting softer than their cry
beached boat each rib extended by a cormorant
setting sun blocked out by cows following it home
cracked stones a coyote's howl widens the gap
Joshua trees ragged in night skies a coyote's cry
light in the coyote's eye playing tricks
cold wind ruffles breast feathers of a gray bird rumors of war
lightning flash into the sound of rain a cricket shrills
nights where you touched me a cricket chirps
parental home several crickets keeping house
slower pulse of an autumn evening crickets
the candle dims a creaking door cricket changes form
a crow's wing tips sweeps from the clouds dark rain drops
crow wings roughened by wind ridged by a cliff
crows landing autumn descends early in a valley town
two crows chasing each other twilight
ebb tides a flock of crows pulled from sea caves
crow in rocks a crack of black quartz holds a nest
a light rain not falling in places the crow flies
Death Valley the crow stands beside his shadow
hard black white sun on the crow's wing before darkening trees
a crow cawing so he too has swallowed a fish bone
translating Japanese into English crows
a calling of crows crisscrossing the air dark streaks flap
a bending of leaves as a deer in passing a sound
steepening the hillside deer nibble wild flowers above the autumn sea
deer hunters soft brown eyes reflecting blue
in velvet the deer with his look of questions
deer hunters guns leaning against the sky blue eyes
dead grass deer bones exposed
from the cabin smells of supper cooking a deer nibbles grass
frost and moonlight separated a dark deer shape
becoming hillside bushes deer
bronze bracken the downed deer not found
a boy watching a deer dying turns with a jerk
a stag's cry a human voice echoes in me
lovesick one wild deer in me
calling the cry of deer human desire
also in meditation to the river bank deer come down to drink
moonlight making in her snowy belly wild-doe milk
evening wind roars still the nearby stag hears my uneven breath
trudging up the path where the hill is the steepest a dragonfly
bridging worlds the grass stalk bent by the dragonfly
dragonflies giving to their wings afternoon skies
lantern light voices in the grass ring my shadow
at our farewell insects chirp in the grasses our lips dry
a jackal howls a black mountain opens moon light doors
sun in darkness monarch butterflies orange and black
flight of a bird unmarked a feather falls
high in autumn a dark bird struggles against the wind
pelicans gathered ready to journey south my bag is packed
migrating ducks changing colors of the lake to autumn
desert lake roosting place for water chickens
floating on the lake the human voices of ducks
dusk horizon drawn by a line of ducks
an owl hoots the autumn wind blowing through the o's
flying in a dream an owl leaves a cry
the moon rises day fades into the sound of owl feathers
dark trees as a pheasant's call night fall
cinders forgotten thoughts
lava hills ashes sparsely covered with ghost weeds
lava pumice the part-time cook recognizes something
canyon walls curved enough for clouds' shadows to climb
desolate canyon with only one note a bird calls
desolate canyon the apple rotten at the core
canyon rim rocks dwarf pines cling with every root
canyon rim something in me flies over precipices
canyon rim walls the sound of zippers going up down jackets
liberated the peasant hen leaves the cock
picking grass seeds how lightly quail go over the land
the female quail only there when she moves
quail crossing hill to hill a shaft of sunlight
rolling a flock of quail on the run
eating the quail that ate the peas planted for winter
shadows moving the forest floor turns to quail
a mother quail followed by her fifteen separate shadows
stolen plums rounding out the tummies of raccoon
aware raccoons on the porch in my sleep
a dream of bears raccoon on the porch peek in the window
red upon red dragonflies chasing autumn
smoked salmon a harvest moon rises in autumn haze
smoked salmon evening sky invites the neighbors in
middle of the night where scorpions creep in cracks
knitting needles the clack of scorpions mating
a piece of night breaks off to strike a scorpion
lightning strikes at the door a scorpion tries to get in
canyon silence skims the wind a roar at the rim
music box canyon wind in the dry river like water running
canyon ledges stones return the music to wind
cemetery wind sounds in the shells of one's ears
all of their possession side by side cemetery plots
out of the cemetery the first laugh a cold wind
thunder knees on graveyard earth tremble
their eyes closed to a million dollar view a seaside cemetery
crossroads cemetery the old man asks the way home
buried here autumn woods are full of ancestors
riverside cemetery late in autumn chilled waters still
leaving the cemetery sunrise on frost-cracked soil
burial ground naked trees veil the sunrise
walking the land that has taken my parents their years
wheels of the hearse packing the powdery snow into useless patterns
swirling white clouds on the desert floor dust devils
neighbors on the road in litigation dust devils
crater winds blowing back in a thousand years
crater where the earth exploded a couple argue
photographing the graves without film
cloud jeweled day blackberry jam on the windowsill
huckleberry jam all the tiredness up in jars
old maid's tea pouring boiling water on unopened flowers
soup bubbles the past lives of vegetables throbbing with heat
pepper shaker in gathering darkness a sharp sound
dinner over the knife is clean and the cup is empty
autumn rain walking about in stocking feet tasting the soup
old buttons threaded on strings lips closed
a blue coat the length and width of a shadow
his old jeans pockets torn to flaps in full possession
early autumn day just right for throwing away old tennis shoes
her ashes forgetting the bad times
morning trees feeling the woodcutters coming to work
chain saw stilled the sound of the ocean comes into view
old forest cutting across the road chain saws
the mountain path being drawn through the woods a sound of saws
chopped kindling the axe head warms scarlet weather
unable to work the scorpion and I stare at each other
on his back the scorpion's mate dead
wood on wood the dry scrap of scorpions crawling between
the many feet myriads of beach flies a caressing wind
high tide backs against the cliff shadflies
newborn flies on the beach dark damp sand
following a vein of quartz the eye of a spirit hawk
up the tree the squirrel stops at the sign "vote for supervisor ..."
a gray squirrel tire tracks in his wet fur
termite tunnel curved by a cypress long in the wind
rising from roots winged termites rusty as redwoods
wild turkey's cry in the cabin at dusk a door closes
undulating backs of wild turkeys blown sea oats
vulture feather white downy fluff at the shaft
church bells a spade cuts through stony ground
open grave frosted air penetrates deep into earth
tending the graves the dirt under my nails is just a beginning
childless standing beside a mother at a child's grave
out of the grave the sinking casket pushes the light
a frosty night gravestones rise the width of a crack
hole in the silence grave diggers alone lower the coffin
between the graves fences between friends falling apart
visiting graves the stone at dusk warms
visiting graves stone gardens lengthen autumn's cool
his grave filled with his earth
his grave covered with my sky
rain covering his grave with low clouds
juicy blackberries under the tangled vines a forgotten grave
after visiting graves a night of fever-chills their nightmares
late afternoon afraid to take nap while visiting graves
last daughter selling his house setting a stone
"gone but not forgotten" the white obelisk in a patch of weeds
forgetting where the family stone sinks in
silence above a chain saw a tree bends
going bald the logger the mountain
years going out the rings of a tree just cut down
puff of exhaust our earth's lungs hauled to the mill
farts the logging truck shifts down
sawdust exciting the air with sunlight
driftwood women at the bar bleached and scarred
singing low sea-white fog disappears into bar lights
life on the river muddy water saloon mountain still
drinking in water the colors of painted canyon
easing into death into earth
angel wings the skeleton's feet arranged in bones
edge of the cliff the old couple discuss going home
my parents their breath gone yet the wind blows
last sip bitter taste of earth in the water
death rattle the bookmark in his Bible does not move
morning sun the basket of fire-starting twigs white with frost
sunset's glow the heat in clay pots being fired
gathering chestnuts in the fall a crack
returning year after year to this one place chestnuts and harvesters
chestnut burrs open and defenseless after harvest
a hunting dog turning the stones into quail
nude sun worshipper the vultures circle the old woman
a band of sunlight on the vulture's wing a feather missing
tangled branches vulture shadows on the darkening
last light out of the cove a dark bird
All Saints' Day pumpkin-grin fangs gone with the werewolf
All Saints' Day goblins and witches baptized with holy names
All Saints' Day the Jack-o-lantern full of gnats
All Saints' Day the moldy pumpkin grins with a harelip
All Saints' Day filling the pumpkin's eyes with raindrops
All Saints' Day among the fall colors angel food cake
All Souls' Day the end table bow-legged
moon shadows the doormat comes alive with a cat's leap
Pleasant Ridge all the caskets side by side
sleeping peacefully the Best Western Motel by the cemetery
grave marker as a cradle headboard rest in peace
abandoned cemetery iron keys cross the ground no one going in
open grave the iron shovel lifts autumn fragrance
tombstones marking those things that don't die
deserted beach alone with the waves of Septemberness
October beach in all the footprints the tread of shoes
autumn blooms soft white cotton balls a harvest field
brown harvest field the balls of white cotton polka dots
maple hills stain the evening sky autumn
barren hills yet patches of purple shadow
steps to the cabin where you once lived low in broken grass
selling the house the scratch of a pen in the family name
a chain of old keys in a closed house unlocking memories
the deed signed taking down the birdhouse dad built
bodies buried and now the house belongs to someone else
village lights stretch down the road draw us home
the afternoon sun slants over a hand-made house paints it September
selling the house one last swim in the lake the water's calm
flying home at 35,000 feet my folks are not here either
nights the dripping roof walks alone around the house on one leg
hot springs cool in the river a jasper stone
desert storm at the resort hot springs
mineral baths at night the many colors in dreams
Death Valley the underground river a healing spring
pulled taut his long eyelashes at the bow
a man with a gun goes alone into the forest of armless hunters
almost there searching the dust for moccasin tracks
no one home the Indian village of house trailers
home from the dentist he brushes his teeth by a lace curtain
wearing the lace behind thin clouds the moon
a kerosene lamp filling the pitcher with sunflowers
long dead he laughs and speaks jerkily super eight home movie
watching the moon grandma goes to sleep with her glasses on
carrying umbrellas strangers in the woods hunt mushrooms
autumn sun in a far cabin corner a dulcimer
putting the dulcimer away the last note lingers drops to the floor
gusts of wind raking leaves in a pile without hands
autumn's dusk the smell of burning leaves brings tears to my eyes
rummage sale at the Lutheran church a rosary
leaning scarecrow real estate dealers also are not upright
new owners the familiar scarecrow left his post
autumn evening adding a long postscript to mom's letter
clods from the grave sweet potatoes piled in a field join at the fence
Death Valley emigrant tombstones mountain peaks
a blob of catsup on the postcard the missing kiss
mother wearing her shoes to her funeral
up in smoke all those years of her anger
the calling of funeral bells a shoestring breaks
an open mouth funeral bells fill earth gap
Funeral Mountains at sunset a halo of golden clouds
the bell tolls rolling the full moon out of darkness
burial driving a car into the trees behind the barn
sundown in ghost town darkness two crows
ghost town in an abandoned orchard fresh apples
ghost town road in a cloud of red dust a dump truck
wind in the waterfall white ghosts
wind in the willows ghost of a woman basket gathering
white moon filling Death Valley ghosts
ghosts Joshua trees shape-changing
dark night old sheets turning into Halloween ghosts
in the fog ghosts by the cliffs change into gulls
moonlight around the hot springs dried salt
in healing waters stars old bodies
soul bathing in hot springs desert stars
Ley lines lines drawn into the earth
earth lines converging flute tones
walking the line within the mountain
a moonlit meadow all the nun are dressed up as clowns
a moonlit meadow chanting women give a voice to dark ages
sea meadow ridge the broken fence moves when the cows come home
heather moors rolled r's of wind between the boulders
patchwork quilt the rumpled beds of heather
clouds of fog hovering over stems white heather
voices winding through the heather moor patterned paths
Death Valley in a bluish haze spectral mountains
mountain peaks folding in prayer for centuries
desert basin mountains washed down flat
salt patterns mountain shapes blue twilight
even mountains gentle easing into earth Death Valley
alkali clouds over lava mountains moonrise
wind mountain inverted in the crater invisible
movement of a bush an animal the wind of mountains moving
abandoned a photo of someone's eyes moving in the wind
one bird its cry so human alone
wrinkling up along the shore an old ocean
mom leaves the door partly open her many years
cricket shapes arthritic knuckles of shortened days
child's fingers trace on grandma's hands the liver spots of aging
an old sea crone remembering mermaid tales as true
hot flashes blushes of youth getting old
grandmother squeezing on her driver's license the name of many men
box canyon walls being with someone you hate
in box canyon the narrow-mined couple argue
after the quarrel chewed cheeks saying the words
sacred grove a spirit trade oaks and I
fairy ring all past secrets come to light
mountain wind the spirit eye sees traveling far
sunset illumination of other worlds clouds
the godless month busy with preparations for Christmas
Halloween being scared to sweep under the bed
Halloween weirdness the old fence post sprouts a pumpkin face
deserted house wild roses still have a view of the remote coast
vacant stares from the vacant house no one looks

Navajo sandstone face of a rock weeping
emerald pools in Navajo sandstone Indian red
Navajo sandstone fissures opening to heaven
painted on Indian cave walls lizard eyes
prayer flags ground shadows in weird shapes
prayer flags tinkling bells
vehicles to heaven pray flags surround the used car lot
remembering mom the same old fire in an altar candle
an altar candle lit for your soul journey warms my hands
pumpkin pies remembering with a grin the Jack-o-lantern
light from the pumpkin's grin a full moon
moonrise wind blows out the light in the pumpkin
carved pumpkin admiring our art the moon comes on the porch
white clouds bury the mountains in deepest black
mountains between us holding back the dawn hours of my longing
mountain caves wind carving empty eye sockets
bodies on Indian ritual ground wrecked cars
where Indians died the carcasses of ponies of old cars
Indian rocks the night hawk's spirit with a whir of wings
pages torn from a sketchbook far mountain ridges
autumn river covering my feet wet with golden leaves
quiet eddy pools swirl at ankles in autumn the ancient dead
in this light flowing through the ages desert river
fall rocks tumble down a dry river bed
white water well-washed river spirits
white ghost waves rocky river ripples roll upstream
wind rushing into the valley rockwater
the top of the rock in the bottom of the pool another stone
winding river road the giant forest approaches night
atop the mountain mammoth rocks stare down a smooth gray sea
bright sun on the long waves of autumn end of a day
night the horizon sinks into the blue water
stones in the desert landscape my bones
ascending alone the threshold to heaven barren rock
dry riverbed in one of its rocks dreamless sleep
flute notes in spirit rocks answers
leaving in a dream soul in the lizard

spirit bodies waving from cacti plastic sacks
Nevada spirit lands garbage blowing in bushes
spirit in retreat cleaning first the black stove a cup of cold water
mission spirits in swallows and pigeons birds of paradise
morning light stretches down the cliff its spirit shape
waiting room a patch of sunlight wears out the chairs
recycling old glass the rocky beach jewel-covered coves
windless surf how easily the old folks are entertained
worn-down hills folding into earth an old dog sits
elephant parade the old aunt absently fingers her throat
clown's old car when it falls apart papa doesn't laugh
surprised in the dark blood is black
his hot cheeks whitened by moonlight the reformed poet
a howling wind at the deep ache a broken bone
weathered palms the scythe well-sharpened worn in the center
enlightened the jack-o-lantern has a fat candle
alone going to sleep with a grin on the pumpkin
all the light inside of a pumpkin this dark night
light leaking the grin of pumpkins growing moldy
together lifting the pumpkin the curved stem
night dark inside the pumpkin its warm glow
scary Halloween the candle in the pumpkin goes out
watching our bed the pumpkin's lid smokes
bedside candle putting it in the pumpkin
shadows moving on the bedroom wall a pumpkin's grin
unable to sleep the Jack-o-lantern watches us all night
grandpa gives the Jack-o-lantern his snag-toothed grin
kite string tightly rolled first day of school
just moved the chill of giggles in the school yard
monoliths shaping the moonlight granite
moon bright where a rock fell away shining
strangers on the city side walks one has his laugh
lamplight straightening the street of narrow houses
approaching the temple grasses rub the body of a snake
logging road cut trees that never come to the temple
before the temple lizards turn the grass brown
climbing temple hill leg muscles tighten in our throats
breathless atop the steep hill temple pagoda
breathless climbing to the pagoda wind
sea winds blow from temple copper domes holy sunshine
Tibetan temple the high-pitched hum of an air plane
to our round eyes temple splendors a locked gate
temple secrets held together a chain link fence
temple fence red and yellow prayer flags poison ivy
holy smells free in the air between fences
temple dump finding something we could see
Sunday morning light from high rocks temples
curving the sky dome temple roof
making temples a full moon 
timberline granite rocks outgrowing the trees
an old woman carrying a balloon dusk lowers
footsteps a language of cripples writing
death by death with the passing of a friend my own nears
afternoon sun on grandma's brown hands star wrinkles
the stable roof shingle for shingle coming down
Ikebana centered around the leaf with worm holes
cracked the antique china cup fills a break in my lifeline
rented house wishing my night gown had all its buttons
autumn path a stick talking to stone the blind man's way
moonlighting the thief employed as security guard
petrified forest you buy a souvenir for your lover
your lies as many sizes of the moon I should believe?
heartless the moon's bright body attracts lovers
garlic toes clinging to his voice the salesman
prayers our feet stuck in sands whispering about us
casting doubts clouds on the hills on her face
used car salesman a banana peel lies three feet from his
after lies seeing by moonlight whose who is what
cold crescent moon sound of a boat leaving with the departed
mother's death the umbilical cord to earth empty
backpack of books the schoolboy becomes a deformed monster
first day of school her bare foot tracks still on the beach
mid-September she writes her name for Daddy in the sand
where we shook hands in front of our old school a dark bruise
after all these years the high school band still practices
still an old maid the high school Latin teacher on a sentimental journey
first day of school on the mountain ridge clouds without thunder
voices along the road after the school bus goes by only birds
river so low all the polliwogs gone school begins
beach afternoon school girls drinking from a paper bag
sea horizons the soul stretched into bands of blue
in the headlights thud of a dark body a soul rushes by
colorful Indian corn for Thanksgiving dinner relatives from afar
Thanksgiving Day an old couple on the pier fishing
cold turkey in bed on Thanksgiving with the sniffles
Thanksgiving Day seeing an old neighbor after her surgery
thanks giving the first cup of water tipped to the earth
Thanksgiving Day after the storm beachcombing
Thanksgiving Day grapes on an heirloom plate half-eaten
red rock waterfall into emerald pools cedar incense
water blackened rocks falling with the waterfall some of them
chipped rock the shape of water falling
old forest on bare paths moths
night shadows the valley floor rises into the sky
tired valley slopes sag
the earth turns in the valley a river bends
Death Valley saving light at dusk salt
Death Valley open blue skies clouded
pale fog yellow vineyards over champagne cellars
wine-tasting at the family-run vineyard a cat too
empty the vacation house watches us drive by
her heat even the ashes not cool
without them hanging on to things of parents
seeing the old home to fill the emptiness chattering birds
a nest found in autumn the empty sky
empty afternoon eyes and ears fill with tears
as empty as Sunday afternoon's envelope your rejection is
filling the washer with an empty heart your blue shirts
autumn storms locking emptiness into summer cabins
tiredness filling the emptiness evenings
used tires loaded on a truck without wheels
sea fog walking the valley with empty hands
crossing the road shadow of a stop sign stops
shadows of an upright stone splashing waves
lifting a shadow the gull frightened by waves
jealous lovers at sea storm clouds with purple waters
slender moon so little fire yet you go to him
tides sorting beach debris a jealous woman
leaving home rain drops in my eyes for clearer vision
grandkids leaving the only smiles on pictures they drew
leaving the low tide beach fills
facing one another the chairs open and empty as guests leave
desert Thanksgiving cold turkey sandwiches under the one tree
blood relatives for Thanksgiving dinner red beets
trick or treating with kids only the moon older than I
without a soul faces grin in the dark on Halloween
no one home yet a face grins on the porch Halloween
going into dark times children dressed as grown-ups begging
from India the strange white bird in a yoga position
banner of belief lace at the edges crumbling
granite altar water not wine wind flowing
ancient shrine just a roof upon the path
chapel hidden on the ceiling pagan symbols
cloister walls shutting in the outer world
holy mountain among the Bishop pines bluebirds
late to church daylight saving unholy times
back home covered with dust magic sparkles
before the coven how the witches park their cars
new age witch in her Honda a whiskbroom
magic symbols drawn with blood this holy space
eggshells ashbone white of the moon in a witch's spell
a little spilled wine ageless women in the circle of a full moon
weak fall sun chairs by the café sit on each other's lap
leaving dust holds your footprints and me
walking on rocks where tears splashed down dad's farewell
wind-filled rain tears at the leaves someone is going
guests gone the only stars in the sieve
guests gone huckleberries ripen in the silence
noodle soup memories of your visit in the left-overs
kissing good-bye she feels the edge of his pocket
 leaving Germany raindrops in my eyes
autumn's summer heat on a white paper you drew a smiling sun
to sleep alone in the light of the moon madness
loneliness crossing the great plains high tension wires
a lonely day yet in the afternoon a breeze comes by
alone in the desert wind
on the porch mold-speckled pine needles my waiting for you
a son's call white waves of long distance returning to shore
kids gone sea waves return to shore each alone
foggy Saturday night a woman's whiskey-raw voice pours from a radio
singing low sea-white fog disappears beneath the pines
late afternoon water leaking out of the cove
afternoon nap a visit with angels how you snore
between fingers the empty air of afternoon
cricket silence between scraping sounds autumn begins
the sky because it is that old that blue
October's bright blue weather out to sea
blue sky coming into the tree's shadow salt winds
blue autumn skies folded into mountains purple shadow
night winds blow on the cabin bed another quilt
autumn taking a dirt road to the end of it
falling from the wreath frost flowers
a wave curls tumbling over a wreath buried at sea
the Vietnam Vet in his eyes my debt
divorced parents the cries of the neighbor kids deep in the woods
the waitress' tip lying in spilled beer small brown coins
dreams burning desire burning
burning pine smoke blown about my longing
deer at the salt lick so my memories of us will you return too?
 fireplace sunshine dark in the burned-out cabin
too late lovers looking in windows of closed shops
touching your left sleeve at this moment of parting how cold is your coat
watercolor class a blue sky pinned to the wall falls
a deaf child in autumn hearing the sleep of seeds
lost in hidden valley the trail
on the gramophone a church in Holland where you are tonight
 early morning sun on the face of the clock
time was my eyes in the empty place where the clock isn't
golden clock hands sunshine slants through leaves passing time
moon dreams a spotlight turns on past lives
fingernails windows to the past lives
white waves returning to shore their call for me to come home
a summer hike in mountain shadows finding autumn
clouds turning off the lights outside the house
mountain stream afternoon clouds washed out to sea
shy before the moon she too slips behind autumn clouds
mountain cold getting under a blanket to sleep with me
white fish fillet the sky fills up with cooler air
after the shower cool wind in the bathrobe hangs on a nail
canyon click nothing on film like the cold wind
in the dark of night who would have thought rain was round
dark castle atop the mountain rain clouds
one at a time rainclouds falling dark into the sea
rainy night the path home a black umbrella
the roof leaves in a drought year in the rain gutter
dusk last light caught in tears
darkness the wideness of things fills the distance
at dusk voices call out stars
tangled branches coming darkness woven in
a wave breaks white a gull folds its wing as the sea darkens
autumn wind the way it turns things around at dusk
dusk the room larger than the persons filling it
dusk shaking out the tablecloth a whir of wings
low-tide walk now deep at sea my path
at the waterfalls a woman remembering a love affair
at least the moon when it's full comes to my porch
ribbon knots tighten a lump in the throat as it was that night...
heavy heart such a color evenings weighs nothing
taking a rest I let the city noises leak out of my ears
pillar of sorrow the hours alone touching it
deep sighing waves climb the beach and disappear
stepping stones go wobbly and uneven tears falling
autumn sadness yet before the leaf falls the swelling bud
eyelash splash curve in the folding a wave of tears
the cutting edge your words where the moon touches night
yet another pine is the moon ever free of the earth?
spirit of a place a film on the photograph
breathing heavily atop the mountain gorge a thick cloud
knuckles of night cold without human flesh tap along the roof
forces holding rocks together apart
mountain top aglow with the unseen moon
walking paths the land fluid without feet
after death naming the unknown heaven/earth
voices familiar things without shadow
eclipse white rocks in the garden bright round
just now with the incoming tide supper time
evenings the long pale waves come ashore
evening comes wrapped in sea fog tied with webs
evening sea fog descending into sun-dried grass sweaty lovers
evening ebb tide the beach widens into a flat sea
evening glow dark the sea shot with color
evening waves come into the cove one at a time
dust so fine the evenings golden air
evening as it is the light lays hot upon our eyelids
evening corners move into the room blown by dark
evening in a secret cove fog bound
evening wind colors of the day blown away
evening winds the tiny bay filled up to the cliff
somber at eventide faces in sandstone approaching autumn
raisins in the oatmeal ants
heat creeping over sand dunes fire ants
cool desert shade moving across hot sands fire-biting ants
a stream of tourists meeting in the desert ants
a line of ants lead to the body beginning to crumble
bone white ants carrying away the darkness
stars carried into caves bat eyes
adding ribs to the colors of midnight a bat
unfolding wings an up-canyon wind a bright bird
surf rolls power in the sand low-flying birds
going home birds across the lake in nests
bird tracks for each line of dust a short life poem
a house in the woods my cage for me to live among birds
swirling dust excitement flickers within the tent
circus red flags flutter hearts
acrobats unfolding the circus tent first
outdoor circus in the center ring a butterfly
juggling sunshine on clapping hands little red hearts
outdoor circus sun on the brightest costumes fading
family circus acrobats lifted high on joined hands
champion on the flying trapeze a butterfly
hearts flying on the high trapeze a blond young man
trapeze artists catching the sun each other
mountain village in the one-ring circus a balance act
juggler the children's eyes in his hands
juggling illusions the circus man with many balls
circus bleachers old enemies crowd close together
circus backstage the heat everyone squirms
tinsel flash under shiny sweat goose bumps
magic act wondering where the scarf went when the wind blew
high wire act on the ground children dance arms outstretched
devouring apricots the fine hairs of her mustache moist and juicy
a huge bow on woody stems azalea pink
grabby hands in the picnic basket bananas
bamboo waving candlelight into the night wind
soap bubbles blooms on bamboo beside the shower
trespassers the scent of bay leaves down on the beach
sea winds in the mountains bay trees
thinning beets finding now and then a fat one
Chinese lantern the brightness within a bee
barbed wire the best berry bushes double-thorned
in foggy moonlight blackberries float in cream her nails are blue
end of the path borage deep in bloom quiet thoughts
fan-leafed white water surges through rocks sprays of buckwheat
doors swinging pendulums between outsiders
moon shadows coming up the stairs a creaking sound
between two birds in bright shapes a real name
flagstones then the border blew away in colored silk
surf sounds someone was walking on trackless sand
bad dreams the shapes of dinner eaten late
night bumps all around the house other things
spindrift veils above the crashing waves finer ones
without wind a door opens the candle goes out
a stand of trees in a setting of weeds someone kneeling
standing ajar for the passage of souls a door in October
incense smoke in the wind chimes faint tones of blue
secret mists on the broad river lost shadows
lost shadows on the dark river time curves
a creaking floor the moonlight goes from room to room
moon path on the water where I walk a bridge to ...
sunset the shadow steps back into your heel
two foreign stamps found in a dream book borrowed
walking on the mountain without a step going inside of it
autumn equinox cool wind comes scented sun-hot pine needles
autumn equinox putting porch furniture away getting it out again
fall equinox sun coming through cedar box trees anthology plans
fog moves as children's hands wave good-bye Sunday evening
whiteness fog erasing the landscape history
sea fog blowing in the valley shapes of hills
broken fence river valley fog patches the gaping holes
sadness fog leaving the sea
fog shrouded a sky without directions the unknown way
ocean roar washing dishes with fog
gray foggy days womb warm with light filtered through a membrane
closing the notebook fog
more fog in the notebook nothing
alone together behind us fog closed the Golden Gate
the wind's eye against the glass a hurricane
Indian summer the cold on my teeth iced tea
moon spirits the face of the deep lightly misted
November spirits playing in the meadow wisps of mist
rolling hills hiding stars in autumn mists
left and right the moon bounces over a mountain road
painted hills the moon of white is real
moon full of blue light desert cool
birds fly on stepping stones of a still pond cloud to cloud
landing a wing spread with light folds into feathers
what is a branch and what is a bird leg? the answer flies away
desert sound in the bird's open beak only the wind
mountain meadow bird call arcs to call in answers
dawn desert silence an oasis of bird song
desert morning bubbles in the hot spring bird song
breakfast campfire coffee cups of bird song
one bird calls the not-yet sun in barren rocks
desert birds music in their beaks running water
going to sleep songs of birds growing dark
night call of a bird without color
summer sky in and out of the nest bluebirds
growing up male color flows into his wings baby bluebird
between pines the summer sky sings bluebird songs
branches bend a streak of feather sky blue
sprinkled breast babies with cinnamon shoulders rare bluebirds
picnic a babbling brook of blue jays
naptime blue jays, too blissfully quiet
up with the birds country living with families of blue jays
winding up the blue jay alarm clock early sunrise
May morning electric with the hum hatching bugs
intermission all the real clowns stand up and smile
between acts the quiet music of bowing trees
clown act without a tent the wind as wild
part of the joke clapping for stagehands who fix the pole
empty morning light the trampled grass circle of the circus tent
dog days a bitch in heat laceless shoes
a field of stars square and curved the American flag
sea winds cutting into a blue sky a square of flag
Independence Day all the fireworks in your eyes
sparklers in the night sky stars
sun burnt and from fireworks star-crazy
patriots etched in their eyes sparklers
sea shells and sky rockets beach holiday
another wave the last sparkler a bent wire
Independence Day the empty flagpole poking stars
Independence Day the lower road bridge collapses
two crows and a sea gull having someone else's picnic
Independence Day the county courthouse blown sky-high
buttercups peeping through fog opening to the sun
a sea of cabbage at the end of each row ocean waves
hot summer day cabbage leaves grow in their stillness
overcoming rocks a stream of cacti slowly spreading
desert ways branching all over cholla cactus
alone and asking to be touched teddy bear cholla
writing desert poems pencil cholla
desert sunset cholla cactus sticks to the light
beach fire pale calla lilies flame bright
old hands pulled carrots let go of earth
severed and warm a head of cauliflower continues to grow
red cedar in a row before evening hills deep purple
sunrise in the red cedar home again
curved walls a split cedar frames the gorge
a breeze fanned out of desert heat salt cedars
salt cedars cooling desert winds bird wings
afternoons turning in salt cedars' sky gold-green
red hearts with centers of stone under cherry leaves
outdoor tub a chinquapin groves bathes in the heat
oasis a bird's nest softly lined in the cottonwood
at the oasis wearing the coolness of willow and cottonwood
still alive in knotty pine walls dragon eyes
without words angels' voices return songs
giant forest moving between trees a deeper darkness
giant forest walking the dark road night trees
at the pass a bright neon-blue bush the future
mineral waters perfume the skin a bright soul
lizard in the slits of his eyes my soul window
beach wind taking off her prayer cap unseen temple
many night thoughts the big dipper tilts spilling over
into valleys a moon full of valleys
headed out to sea the tide-pulling moon in the rear view mirror
desert tides the moon shapes sand stone
a little higher another valley fills with the moon
quivering branch the moon climbs higher in the old pine
opening the door for more firewood there's the moon
from barren trees shaking wildly serene moves the moon
fields flat with fog the radiance of the moon fenced with rough slats
moonsky starlight bends and fades into a halo
higher from earth the mountain moon brightens
radiance expands the moon blows free of a rumpled earth
white moon filling the dry valley with light
in hot springs the moon warms itself between us
gurgling in mineral waters the moon bathed
each step up the mountain the moon whiter
evening mountains a line of milky blue round the moon
a rack of clouds arranged by the moon in shapes of white
peeking thru pines bright eye of the moon my neighbor
crevices in the face of rock the moon
yellow bugs on the lettuce squished are yellow inside also
these bugs! yesterday I squashed those bugs
clapping praise without hands a butterfly
fluttering the butterfly has no time for a name
eyelash curves a glance teases a butterfly
a flower lifted from the stem floats a butterfly
even while resting butterflies go on dreaming of flight
waiting at the corner only a butterfly and this lovely girl
walking with a butterfly here I too pause
end of summer following it out of sight a butterfly
before the hot sun white on the butterfly's wing melted transparent
a face among the flowers then the butterfly folds its wings
butterfly colors the air woven with healing
a broken crayon the path of a butterfly drawn by a child
high fashion butterflies decorate my garden hat
a yellow cat melting in the August sun summer days
the cat's milk swimming with ants hot in August
summer's heat caged in the stripes of a ginger kitty
to and fro in a hammock a cat purrs
buzz of cicadas pushing quicksilver up the thermometer
a shrill cry overheated the cicada peels out of its skin
soft morning air the quiet afterbirth of the cicada
Independence Day the parade majorette with the shorter skirt
holiday a marshmallow wind on browning bodies
5th of July the portable ice chest drying inside out
a single mom the paper days until school is out
summer breeze the shouts out of school children again
summer skies the clearness of children's voices out of school
school picnic someone very young teaches him to boogie
school picnic the ticket seller raises her fingers as she adds
Mid-summer's Eve lately bracken fern invisible
mid-summer day and night balanced no wind
a broken shoe string summer begins barefoot
holes in the hammock thoughts run through my mind unfiltered
black pine against the never dark sky Mid-summer's Eve
Midsummer's Eve her brief white gown shortens the night
Tanabata and beside me tonight an empty pillow
seaside vacation unwinding the kite string unwinding
in desert sand cinder temples seem to be from China
Grand Canyon tourists sucked out of California by a big hole
wind perfumed from a woman's shoulder desert night
leaving the beach only she has sand on her back
sand where lovers laid a shallow depression
summer sun drops of sweat mingle with sperm
eyelids closed the naked sleepers curled into fish
lying naked open to summer stars this old couple
the whole bed yet he lays his head in my hand
sea fog hiding morning-mussed hair places you've kissed
sweeping the floor sunrise on papers left by lovers
he's angry again alone on the porch with a red star
hot air his arguments on my face
crumpled silence after the argument moth wings
our angry silence old faithful geyser blows off steam
ocean front on the most expensive lot cow parsnip
creosote bushes afire with morning sun fuzzy seeds
creosote blossoms sunset rain clouds familiar perfume
sun's burning heat grows green and tall creosote bushes
rain colored the light circling a daisy
going around yesterday's bath water today's daisies
one flashlight in the daisy meadow stars
dill weed hung to dry by the back door scrapes the windy wall
a sunny porch shaded with an umbrella drying dill
river water shaping clouds duckweed
among dune grass silver bleached logs and a perfect day
waves dune grass waves
dunes in knotted grass a perfect star
an arch of elms so vast something of mine is carried upward
twilight storm the heaving dragon in the old elm
summer visitors at the cliff's edge farewell-to-spring
out of earth the flower shape of a hole
a swinging gate on both sides the flowers open - close
windy weather calling the flowers by name each nods
flower shapes in dried mud blooming
desert flowers their colors too are hot today
flowers by the door nameless except for the color of these blue days
full white moon the colored earth rolls around
rounding soft old hills an ancient moon
moonbeams the tender roots of passion flowers
a crescent moon earth cut off from heaven by the fog
crescent moon a bowl of brightness full of night
hollow in the dark of the moon howling
a dark moon the cold white rim of an enamel pan
close to my moon Jupiter with all of his brightens the night
face of the moon in the hot tub a swirl of bubbles
moon clouds cooling the mountain side a sunless shape
spotlight between rocks a bit of moon
white light burning up rocks moon magic
dark world only rocks bright where the moon goes
moving rocks moon rolls over the mountain none fall
doorknob the moon looks down on its tiny self
rocks piled before the moon drop back to earth
the full moon walking the island road from sea to sea
full moon ripples reflecting unseen stars
so full the moon brightens the room with poems
all moon filling the secret cove with bright water
a full moon drawing down to the sea a path of stars
a show for the price of peanuts three chipmunks
buoy bells from rock shadows cormorants
sea meadows as rocks and cows rocks and cows
sunset the great bull closes both eyes
cooling cows the tree extends its shadow over a yellow one
by the bullpen a fence has torn off a red shirt
hearing the cuckoo calling out for a lover morning seems so young
dog days hoping the stray pup comes back
backyard circus for the price of a penny the neighbor's dog barks
morning fog the calling of doves many small circles
cooing doves lengthening the coolness of shade trees
a hollowness waiting for the dove to call again
doves lingering by the dark door feather light
swing still the rope squeak of a dove
mountain climbers resting in an eerie eaglets
mountain peak an eagle leaves it moonlight
Grand Canyon deeper with each camera click the tourists' smile
in the roar of Yosemite Falls photos kids' scared smiles
under Cathedral Spires two ancient Sequoias and a trash bin
quacking ducks on my favorite beach tourists coming
clouds come and go just as quickly on the beach tourists
Lake Tahoe tired eyes stare down at a tiny rivulet
desert poverty even dirt has been left in the casino
bare tops Death Valley tourists on a hot day
tourists overlooking Badwater each with a Coke
tourists in Italy Pan's pipes and the Crucifix in one museum
out-of-season tourists at San Juan Capistrano hummingbirds
scenic spots full of a century of tourists' eyes
mountain gorge before the great view falling asleep
snobbish hotel the rusty old cars of employees
around the pool their nipples exposed men!
mountain river shriveled to harmlessness summer tourists
surf sounds then my motel neighbor turns off the shower
lying on the bed layered with other lives motel night
motel morning the strange bird's song in another migration
vacation finally relaxing fog dissolves
vacation ends one last splash of a wave I am gone too
this heat the harp too out of tune
the neighbor lady scolding her child is also god
picking up sleep where you left it at dawn afternoon nap
sun from the east ocean waves from the west our entertainment
dancing on the beach I jab a stick into the sky to break up the blue
white dance in the beach walk skirt folds of moonlight
I come to you clothed only in the dampness of fog and our dancing
hard glances the sun on the sea a virile man
she showing him a sea cave and more
almond nails pressed into brown skin a faint perfume
moon lights houses of hermit crabs my damp blanket
star paths the tender roots of passion
voices bridging the stream stepping stones
your voice tying me to the desert toast pops up
airport phone call the heart leaves without luggage
flying the mountains bend down to our meeting
departing summer and when it's gone the river's low
one leaf floats in the sand castle's moat end of summer
circus acrobats come to the end of summer leaping and falling
asleep in a boat to dream the dreams of water lilies
where do they go? these flowers by a path summer's passing
gathering flowers unexpected guests come to dinner
days opening/closing flowers
depth of a flower flying away with the bee some mystery
canyon walls crumbled flowers float out to sea
magic hand even in the meadows foxgloves
foxgloves everything's funny in this heat
night unrolls another gardenia more white
fanning my cheek a gingko tree loans us its papery leaves
 bearded grasses the same age
 the meadow mowed blue sky presses down
bales of straw without cow curves lying in the meadow
late summer grasses above their roots the seeds nearly touching
sheaves of grass water that does not break flows in ripples
faint with dews the full moon slides closer to the sea
full moon holes in stones echoes
mountain giving birth to white light a round moon
full moon sculpting sandstone with light
full moon letting him in with the light
full moon rising over ash mountains alkali dust clouds
from earth a light moon rises tides
moonrise in the rear-view mirror sunset
full moon covering the long dry valley with light
desert cool rising to the full moon desert pool
a full moon cutting a lock from the cowlick
cabin alone the greater moon waits our return
a full moon the crazy neighbor's lights burn all night
closing a slim book print shrinks in the face of a full moon
bending the pine tree with a windy sound the full moon
filling the river the complete moon covers the hole in the bridge
touching her face fingerprints on the full moon clouds
a full moon resting on hoary frost meadows tundra swans
full moon moves from poem to poem through the pine
round moon rolling from the ridge gray stones here and there
airport up in the smoke faces I've met there
waiting area mom and dad's faces grounded
airport carpeting the dizziness above and below
before boarding a finger on the wingtip cold and sweaty
among strangers sun rises without a night flares on metal wings
barefoot her sweat socks still do
smooth sand chasing children down the beach their foot prints
watered silk bright surf catches her pants leg
a huge wave rolling up her pants still wet
sea cliff home nestled by cypress house finches
our kisses on our legs fish kisses
salmon fingerlings swimming by the nude beach eyes bulging
jumping in a river of fingerlings our bodies too pale
lightning fireflies above puddles peek at themselves
on my ankles the cat ignores the bites of her fleas
a little clumsy the scrub jay teaches fledglings to fly
company's comin' even the flies buzz at the door
drone of flies curved as desert sand around noon
before one's very eyes heatwaves shimmering flies
if only flies would nap among the cats and books on wicker chairs
surf rolls life in the sand beach flies
fly wings fanning summer hotter
helping him out the fly is crushed against the door
tucked in bed warm summer days of goose down
sand dunes drying the wings of each gnat
shadowed river transparent wings of gnats the only light
desert pond in the national park goldfish
summer passing the ripple on the koi pond an orange fin
desert nights the clarity of dreams warm and real
dream dancer sleeping without a pillow on scarred boards
remembering a dream and then the circus was over
eyes closed knowing by heart the rest
days so complete words become the calls of birds the high tide wind
only borrowed this summer day this beach
wet silk cupping her breast night river
outdoor shower bathed in sun colors of hot water
slipping into the pool naked divides the night sun-warmed waters
gentle nights of desert wind a woman's breast
touching myself your name on my lips
placing the flute against her lips something slips into place
British pub an unfaithful man blows suds from his beer
getting into bed the stranger even browner
eating melon bites given on the point of his knife
the blood circle mother and daughter wading in the surf
I'm not old all night my eyes have held the ancient stars
with the ocean's roar I climb the hills home not alone
long grass bending over road ruts curve the valley slope
walking home after the circus how dry the grass
sea promontory wild-winged grass seeds birds fly up
bending a bit summer grasses watch me enter the pool
stalk of grass a thin shadow joining others for the night
picture taking such a lovely day gladiolus
green apples crowding on the branch full of sunshine
green plums tapering the hardness swift-passing days
silence of a green leaf eaten by a worm
silence of summer leaves pure laughter
silence in a grove of green leaves ancient suns watching
silence green leaves sly smiles more knowing
sunshine lights on hibiscus leaves before their own dark
hollyhocks pink light shining as a cup
cupping pink light without hands hollyhocks
Joshua trees on the ridge flute notes higher and lower
Sunday morning desert sermons of Joshua trees
juniper shade sleeping with tourists on cool lava rocks
smoke shaking from its folds leafy trees along the railroad
summer departs all the warmth left in leaf fires
out of earth the heart shapes leaves
a gift for the town gossip a head of lettuce
harvest moon watching a mouse hole the ginger cat
turning out the light renting the room to the moon for a night
a hazy moon steam no longer seen from the hot tub
clear moon rising from a mountain ridge darkness on its face
smudged moon marked by mountain fires soot and smoke
a hunter's moon the o's of howling dogs ring in the mists
late rising the lop-sided moon half the night
night without poems then comes the moon
late moon in the poor part of town second-hand light
the tiny dawn pine mountain releases the late moon
ripe huckleberries the moon comes up streaked with purple
late moon shivering before mountains cold knees
a falling star the nearly round moon still not full
clear night moonlight coats feathers
brushing moonlight across night skies wispy clouds
moonlight on the way to dawn vivid dreams
green water curls into white foam moonlight
pale violet sheets in silver moonlight native hills
moonlight in the high desert a river
missing the malls on the ocean beach she gathers shells
the fat child gathers the most sea shells pockets bulging
high tide the beach leaves a mark in her book
afternoon wind all the beachcomber's words blown out to sea
heat wave on the beach crowds cool fog
cold beach walk on sun-warmed car seats two sweatshirts
curls of waves yet on the beach all day her hair goes straight
smuggler's cove stones wash on the beach the size of skulls
a special beach I put a pebble in my mouth before leaving
car doors slam essence of starfish comes home with us
beachcomber gift of civilization a hairbrush
beach bums at a sermon of gulls one tries to sleep
smelling the light on her tanned shoulder home from the beach
cyclist picking up a nail from a crosswalk
flat country lane a man on a bike slices the sky
tourists too tipsy to drive out in a canoe
choppy waves the small boat between two worlds
behind the speedboat water bent and broken mends with ripples
streaked with gold sunset in the rich folks' harbor the tallest mast
in a canoe a man eating a banana peeled
a summer day drifting by in a canoe
here grasshopper at pepper plant restaurant aphids!
breaking waves the screams of gulls soft sand
skimming waves spindrift feathers a gull
along the cliff wing tips of gulls at eye level
high tide mark gulls search another time
before us the road flown by two sea gulls
gull wings lifting the light from the sea
gulls playing with the wind their shadows
blue white swirls in evening skies gulls
cutting up a cove's high seas the soaring gull
sea birds home on shores of booming surf the unused songs
Sunday beach a sermon of sea gulls one goes wading
mountain overlook twinkling above the sea a flock of gulls
sea gulls over land and water smoke from fire
tearing together fish entrails gulls' laugh
on rocks the first sunshine a gull
lunchtime overlooking the road ahead a hawk
fog billows the gray streaks of a hornet's nest
end of summer walking the riverbank just a heron
sweeping bare floors the summer empty cabin very full
glowing a flag unfurls native happiness
long summer day how many animals I've been
on a bright sunny day comes your smiling face light added to light
just two stars yet our eyes are closed in ecstasy
high cliff the heart beats the blue sky like a flaying stick
kissing together in a glass our toothbrushes
desert kisses hotter than ever before
morning stars fade waking a small bird our lips
summer night empty mountain road filled with our laughter
laughter added to the heat my lover's farts can't kill mosquitoes
angel wings propelled through the air by laughter
tongue tasting pink
shapes pure light the face of a loved one
blue spots tattooed with love from his teeth
holy of holies in the scroll a lily unrolled
each day celebrated by lilies opening
sunset still the orange lily awake
swollen belly the tiger lily bends its stripes stretch marks
lunchtime lilies above the book reading
what to serve for lunch that matches the lilies found at the door
point blank the whiteness of lotus petals spinning
left nor right all sides open the lotus
live oaks rooted in a petrified trees I have a photograph
rolling down a petrified log acorns
fitting in with granite boulders sacred oaks
marigold squinting in the summer sun wrinkled nose smell
marijuana leaves my neighbor's garden in a stolen car
muskmelon for desert the new moon
fanning a breeze out of desert stillness mesquite trees
mesquite green moving to touch lizard skin
desert dinner dates and honey mesquite without water
lying down under mesquite shrubs shade and I
moonlight faces in the sandstone cove laughing
one half a cup of low-fat cottage cheese in the moonlight
a window slants from a rough stone fireplace a square of moonlight
dancing around in the moonlight outstretched hands
nothing moves moonlight touching wind chimes
containing a dish of moonlight ritual salt
moonlight radiance behind clusters of dark pine white clouds
beach sand wet with moonlight ebb tide
moonlight following raccoons across the porch
alone how cold the moonlight on my bed
sitting in moonlight the empty chair full of radiance
in my bed a spot of moonlight the empty pillow
out to cool on the porch cakes frosted with moonlight
promontory holding up moonlight crevices of sea caves
moonlight clothes from the dryer fresh and clean
moonlight slipping from her breasts the white blanket
covered with moonlight the face of the mountain my wrinkles
a rock fantasy shaped by moonlight fears
moonlight highway yellow crossing yellow line of pee
mountain road winding road with a yellow line
mountain road the glow in the moonlight a night snake
moonlight reflected from rocks into haiku
a quiet bay with seaweed and rocks the sun at rest
a forest walk ending at the beach roots
morning beach blue sand still quiet in the tracks
cold wind on the beach foam fans
beach fire flowing into waves flames
rushing in - rushing out the wave's mini-vacation on the beach
darkening beach the warmth of a person's eyes for the sinking sun
drowsy-colored the summer afternoon weighs nothing
desert air invisible smoke of sagebrush clear
softness desert air flows through giant rocks
coming to sea cliffs the off-shore breeze raises a flower fragrance
beach tent billows in the summer blue white clouds
desert sounds out of the sun's way clouds moving
morning downpour raised to new heights afternoon clouds
dancing lights clouds sprinkle the sun across water
clouds colored by open wall a driftwood lair
river's bend wave lengths of setting sun broken by a canoe
rowing on the lake boats filled with empty sounds
stopped down by the river's pace drifting boats
studying waves he drifts off to sleep
cabin closed the waiting in the woods as we come
the tiny cabin listening to pine wind its very own planks
early summer cabin walls leaking late night cold
back again in the summer cabin winter dreams
tin roof hearing the edge of a cloud wet with rain
warm dry air the river low in August a door opening
leaving for home summer cabin floors swept bare
camping man's first home a wall of green wind
pillared by pine driftwood logs slanted sunlight
a driftwood shack remembering other times places
fights forgotten neighbor kids building a club house
the open window screened with a web leaf shadows
remaking the bed the river flows by the campground
nearly awake sea-gathered light on sleeping faces
environmentally sound wiping the new-age camper with recycled paper
summertime the way to the circus childish voices
carousel the sun goes around up and down
Berkeley sidewalks the rest of my education on the street
selling peace buttons he buys the mulatto a coffee room for the night
a flutter of flowers hovering in the heat hummingbirds
roof newly shingled nestled under pine cones lady bugs
surprising tourists on the beach meadow larks
above wild flowers the song of the lark widens the meadow higher
flowers songs while looking out to sea meadow larks
stones a patterned shadow moves on lizard legs
a hot wind secrets of dunes from a lizard
a patch blue sky the belly of a lizard filled with flies
flying water into desert lizards gnats
wind echo in round rocks lizard eyes
eyes painted on cave walls lizards
ancient eyes on cave walls lizards
lizard eyes a summer cooled by the glint
lovers pulse of fire gods in bubbling waters
lovers cradled in caves lovers
hot tongues the little language of lovers
lovers the lamplighted lane a way away
nights the grove of little trees swollen with lovers
moon white water lovers in the secret cove Saturday night
just as tangled paths in the berry patch lovers
lovers heat of a summer night fill the moon
making love the unevenness of boards on the porch
skin touching whispers
a butterfly from your finger light touches
following wet tracks into the secret garden he enters
hovering hums mosquitoes watch us making love
packing between unworn shirts sea sounds
moments of forever beach day chitin fossil in lava
gazing into fires seals in my mind wind-water pictures
red marks from your white teeth mosquito bites
curving sandstone cliffs the yellow school bus where time stands still
memories over a river of sunlight a time bridge
mesquite trees choosing the best spots for shade
desert wind finding voices in mesquite
mint-pickers stained with fragrance fingers wave hello
damp windowsill mold writes in the notebook little black poems
fault line opening monkey flowers
morning glory unfolding dewdrops blue skies
stone Buddha essence still blooming in moss flowers
thatched roof growing again moss
musty smell of old furniture a mossy bank
ancient stumps with faces in the moss tourists peek inside
desert hills unfolding coolness in a fan palm
for desert rain hot winds rattle dry palms
date farm selling coolness in brown bags
the most ancient palm-green filtered dates of light
passion flowers climbing on the bed lovers on the porch
lovers twining on the porch passion flowers
evening orchard where the sun sank in peach sky
ripe peaches the heaviness tips the days into summer
a plate of peppers red warming up August's afternoon
stone Buddha here the phlox too grows straight
a little higher another valley fills with moonlight
autumn leaves arranging on the earth silver moonlight
glacier-scarred rock centuries of moonlight echo
moonlight in canyon echoes stars
moonlight your image on the mountain echoes forever
eastern peaks withholding moonlight echo your voice
moonlight in the mountain river stars echo
moonlight shaped by leaves of gold silver
mountains holding up the moonlight the highest peak
two headlights four white eyes of moonlight
moonlight broken to bits by fallen leaves
draping moonlight over your image a leafless tree
rolling to the crest moonlight touches each tree black
autumn leaves on the earth silver moonlight
a black stove warming a square of moonlight
round rocks the new moon rises old
water striders on a pale pond moons
cactus spines above the desert a slender moon
incoming tide curves of spindrift flung high a quarter moon
sewing by hand slowly it comes together the half-round moon
quarter moon on the night table a book face up
scattered in sand embers of a saltwood fire face to face with stars
shell beach wind blowing through a train whistle
city folks playing on the beach board games
city voices on the beach the litter
sunny day blown on the beach clouds of sea foam
damp beach sand where a naked witch squats her heart
lonely beach walk losing in the sand car keys
tracking the cliff-bound beach noon clouds
beach fire pale calla lilies flame bright
again on the beach drifting with dreams she tracks sand
the beach blowing sand in water colors
a windless day the beach colored sea foam
pocket beach after the climb back up sand in mine
gravel beaches the corners of the river elbowing
summer fog the beach wrapped up in itself
wooden bridge words found by a splinter in bare feet
bridge timbers a rumble in the creek flowing under them
curving with the land a rainbow of clouds moves out to sea
ocean clouds here and there a sailor's wish
sea clouds film long exposed to a white water river
shell-shaped the highest peaks swirl clouds
majestic peaks making majestic clouds we shield our eyes
clouds canyon walls of Yosemite
thunder rolling up the mountain great white clouds
after the rain breathing deeply white valley clouds
western peaks the last clouds set afire
between boards shadows on a sunny porch a slender coolness
light rippling the lake with coolness
the August moon rises with the coolness of a thunderstorm
daylight in paths of falling stars flights of birds
alone climbing the afternoon peaks the day moon
sparkling on bright water unseen day stars
first light pouring into lava mountains cloud red
dawn with the light winds
morning sun the twinkle of stars still in the dew
sudden downpour now we outdoor folks own a waterbed
drought white a withered tree hangs over the bath tub
unearthly silence of a drought year drying
constipation from dry desert winds only farts
street woman her tits at home in T-shirts
city park hands of the blind sparrows
home from haying the weight of a wooden rake on sun burnt shoulders
a giving sound wheat leans into the mowing machine
it is still hot tractors coming home with headlights
sound of a fan blowing a cool hole back into summer
paper and sticks the coolness of a ocean painted on a fan
dry wind the smell of smoke bright red
hot moon marked and spotted gray by forest fires
plowing a firebreak the dry earth a cloud of smoke
clearing a trail it only seems clean after a shower
fruitstand the girl-watcher pinches a peach
your long letter a garden around me tall white summer skies
gardens voices among flowers patterned paths
evening song the scythe set a stone leans on the fence
snapping beans she doesn't look up when the gate slams
garden spider at home in a hat dangles at my ear
a new hoe chopping the grasses of last spring
cabbage gardener seeing white butterflies in a new light
long walk home the incoming tide refills footprints
hot stones footprints of swimmers going home
homeward bound our days of vacation in brown skin
a dry scrape as the door slams lizards run
summer a brown twig becomes a lizard
salt cedars gray moving to touch lizard skin
heat exchange in a sudden breeze two lizards
giant boulders the lizards arrive late for the flute concert
mayflies a pair of birds playing catch
heart pounding the tiny animals that scurry within the earth
added to stars swarm of mosquitoes obscure the view
the sting of a summer alarm clock mosquitoes
late letter worded with mosquito bodies my blood
summer melting mosquitoes' sound in a harmonica
drowned mosquito it's dangerous to swim in my navel
swatting mosquitoes how lightly goes a life at sunset
dead mosquito no longer interested in biting me
braiding in her hair last night's dream a tiny moth
Gypsy circus in the tent moths
the narrow bed we breath each other all afternoon
on bare arms the noon-day sun melted hot metal sweet
before the summer storm rises the close smell of two skins
after paying the whore seems to be someone's sister
applause scenery painted by a one-armed boy
company's coming over-friendly flies buzzing at the door
prostitute now a freeway rest area her mother's home
finally it's Friday the passion flower blooms wrinkling the bedspread
crawling on the bed tendrils of passion flowers thick on the porch
shadows of leaves cover the open holes her flute forgotten
the sun and hunger watches without winding on a summer day
tourist fear the ocean will ruin Land's End clothes
clasped hands holding the nervousness in his thumbs
in rain in sun how do you run from your hours window box zinnia?
shelling peas the pregnant woman asks "Is forty old?"
silence in a knot hole stares
traveling through Basho in your town you in mine
beach party losing in the sand her many years
a world closed the roar of surf plugs my ears
quiet evening all the wind back in the flute
on vacation the summer sun far out to sea
summer stars finding all the familiar things edged with morning
midnight the dark smell of ripe plums
warm rain purple in a plum lips
hill country golden parachutes land here poppies spread wide
sleepy garden red parachutes land here in the poppy's dream
summer day with poison ivy even hotter
berry picking the stain of love colors my cheeks
painting the river low in summer moss green
heaven on earth low in river clouds of moss
up and down on pillows of moss river ripples
rose gardens just inhaling deeply feels like stealing
rose breeze leaves of a bush shiver white
a cut rose that voice spirals into galaxies
still spinning the Gypsy's rose falls in his lap
musk rising from the petaled labia a red rose
swirled to the center stillness without moving rose petals
ruby lights darkness in a rose crisscrossing
ocean cliff deepening sunset wild rose
bathing outdoors in the rosemary bees rubbing buzzing
lightning strikes in the roots of trees patterns echo
sand sage dunes brushed clean by spiky flowers
sagebrushed rain drops
quarter moon such a face of darkness yet you go to him
my longing voices ask the moon for news of him
awake waiting for the moon him
waiting for moonrise the scribbled haiku illegible
washing dishes that half of the moon makes them shine
mountain winds half the moon blown away
reflecting on the quarter moon broken granite
alone in the hot tub the quarter moon seems only half there
rising above lava mountains the cratered moon
sparks above the rising moon a plane lands
fire my companion too faithful to go outside see the cold moon rise
a rising moon her scoop-necked blouse moves with her breath
unable to hold back moonrise the cry of pleasure
over mountains the moon rises roughly scarred
moon rise winds from those barren rocks moving black pines
scratching his back from crooked pines rises the moon
pine needles radiating light from dark limbs moon rise
moon rise waiting in darkness all of us trees
salty sea fogs on closed meadow flowers moon rainbows
bridge song vocal chords of the river
meandering brook my good intentions melting away
canyon wash clean and dry
canyon closing out sea sounds
rain-torn canyon walls catch the sun
canyon walls slip into the valley river gravel
noon clouds finding in the canyon opals
wall by wall the canyon releases blue rock deep night sky
box canyon in a dried up wash ancient river rock
ancient river rock running once again down a muddy canyon
paint box canyon the river a rainbow of rocks
oldest rose stone canyon walls folded in time
cave walls turning to sand footprints
translucent wall in the sea cave a shell
avalanche blue sky presses into the cliffs
cliffs sloping into the sea gull wings
sheer beauty cliffs drop straight down raising spirits
taking sunshine into a secret cove steepest cliffs
green growing steeper than seacliff meadows a lush smell
coast ranges distance spills into the sea
leaping up a wave comes into a secret cove
cupping the eye the quiet cove on a rocky coast
rustling on the roof leaves of a drought year in the rain gutter
behind me fog closes in the Golden Gate
ocean fog hangs in the pine trees a white hammock
sunrise finds fog in the valleys fingers in sand
fog the sun and I shout the morning
evening fog a door slams softly
crackle of paper an afternoon of shopping the heat
hot night sleep too has melted
vibrating crystals the heat moving mountains
heat waves bringing to the desert an ocean view
heat wave the nautilus shell unwinds
a high wave bumping the horizon curled by blue
evening drawing a line of pink mountains
on the horizon waves by the buoy bump the sky
incoming tide covers sun blackened rocks with a hot day
sun in a towel drying a wet body the hot day
summer light spun into a handmade rug lambs wool
gazing at sunset the dark road home filled with light
last light rising out of the cliff seven gulls
today's light goes into the sea an open window
power lines lacing the sky with electricity
out of darkness that covers stars lightning
driving in time rivers flow backwards as we leave the sea
going home down the mountain road sunset
leaving the ocean waves come back
tracks on the beach all the feet have returned to the city
welcome home the far ridge filled with thunder
coming home to the rest of rain all day long
the way home a scent of open fires clinging to my wrist
the weight of eyelids home from the beach full of sand
home again a bath and the towel with a blue border
hikers rest at the waterfall coming down to earth
heavy sweating the taste of mountain on a hot day
squeaky knee joints canyon river sounds coming up the hill
canyon springs where water rest in light travelers pause
going down the mountain its rocky river words still in our ears
tired bones back-packed in a mountain hike
"the back of my hand" he said and we were lost
looking down the tops of trees rooted in the canyon
hitch hiker leaving the no-camping area his pack all lumpy
one path heel to toe and warm
mountain climbers their voices higher than the rocks
against my cheek a touch of powder moth wing
fog thickening into the lampbeam a moth
a garden lantern attracting a few moths and all the stars
silver gray words a quiver of moth wings in hard green eyes
nights a moth at the window star-crazy
up under the roof between our legs small birds fly into nests
osprey silver between his talons spindrift fish
spreading his tail corn flung in the flight-fan draws the peacock
wave to wave pelicans follow flashes of lightning
pelicans clowning tops of waves
among cholla cactus soft on the cottontail
soft-eyed seal watching a lone man and his daughter
wave within a wave riding one a seal his heart pumping
curve of waves leaping seals thicken translucent waves
barking seals their breath comes to the mainland as mist
waiting for rain the slow way slugs make love
winding creek the snake's tongue forked
in a trail of manshade shadow snakeshadow
desert road snaking through low hills
sidewinder getting us off the trail without a step
a jog in the trail a sidewinder
unwinding a cobra a ring of round notes from the flute
campfire embers all the demons nearly gone in the morning sun
distance softens and rounds the hills our relationship
his penis in her lightning strikes very close
a gentle rain in me your poems
curve of a wave holding perfect a summer day
satisfaction the cooling breeze between lovers
my head resting on the pillow of your voice
we share these hours gifts with many small parts complete together
beaches where no one goes their share of sand gentle waves
tiny cabin distant shelter of woods and sky within me
caught between rocks seaweed in the rising tide seems to wave to me
smooth sand following waves back to the sea
summer weary the sky leans down an arch of cypress
asleep holding your breath in my hand
beach-blown my sea-foam body awaits your hand
hot night legs spread wide where sleep should be
neon lights blink glances pass underneath dark lashes
hung over the bed the unpainted painting mosquito netting
a new year rising from wild seas a few stars
be begin the year fresh sheets of winter's night snow
moon mirror reflecting a wrinkled face born the same day
my age spoken four years ago a younger sound
birthday beach walk wetted by a wave born again
a huge wave thundering across the beach my birthday
in the tub the day before being born
bells in the natal place a uterus opens
 sky-clad the new-born comes wrapped
mountain echo I'm older when I hear it
a shower of diamonds my birthday gift from a snowy branch
sagebrush raindrops mixing with earth odors in hot springs
desert air invisible smoke of sagebrush clear
surf boom on the meadow sea rockets
waves washing rocks covered with palm kelp tropical landscapes
coming from the sea light on shore pines blue-green waves
shore pines sharp shaped by wind of Point Arena
seaside curved by shore pines rounded rock
writhing on hot sand the meager shade of smoke trees
heat of the day on the desert floor smoke trees
desert filling the dry river smoke trees
flowing from rock crevices smoke trees
snapdragons bowing low before the rain of the sprinkling can
sheer cliff ever-bearing stone crop
open fields on the tip of his tongue a strawberry
tasting of wild strawberries your tongue
our tongues strawberries tasting each other
sea fog swirls in the wild sweet peas
vacation house plants the sweet potato vine in a mason jar
a kerosene lamp filling the pitcher with sunflowers
sunflower in a month of petals counting the days
shiny wet the sketch of thistle down in black ink
behind the new fence his one weed gazes at my stand of thistles
mountain pass night's bright rainbow a haloed moon
full moon in a veil of clouds round rainbows
moon shadows writing letters deep into the night
in my moon shadow the neighbor's gray cat warms itself
moon shadows when the wispy clouds blow free
moon shadow curving into darkness fear
moon shadows writing in a journal daydreams
darkness sinking into the sea craters of the moon
stars scattered a few fishing boats gather by the sinking moon
showers pass on each dark stone a tiny round moon
moon set now it's right - how it fits Half Moon Bay
full the moon setting into the sea earth fragrance
midnight the full moon shines a bit flat
going out to sea the moon fills spaces with my eyes
growing bright a fog bank at sea melts the moon
night cooler now the moon has slipped into the sea
guiding the moon into the sea boat lights
pulling its path down into the sea the sinking moon
a brightness smudging the night the moon is gone
easing the moon into gentle seas your snoring
among starfish the changing moon sinks into the sea
Uhebehe Crater* the inverted mountain made of wind
crater rim our kissing with open mouths
taken by a creek both feet exploring wet
desert flapping in the wind the whole town
desert a stretched horizon of silence
desert town tropical fish store well stocked
sand curing the glare high noon
sand dunes rimmed creosote bushes bloom sunset colors
rain-wet dunes scraped with yellow light of sunset showers
noon shadows following the contours of desert dunes
living in desert dunes the ups and downs of curved sand
hot spring in desert dunes noon memory
dunes mountain peaks as hot and dry
retreating from the eastern world coastal dunes
night dunes in the warm places ants
drought on the way to church dust devils in the road
earth awake quake
remodeling plans the whole house sways earthquake!
trembling the earth touches us all
forked lightning the river begins in the sky
car lights curve nights along the coast flashes of lightning
in a streak lightning across the floor a scorpion
long day waiting for the cove to fill with water
longer day the sun lingers in the warmth
moonlight unfolded from clean sheets covers the bed
moonlight a child's high voice above the darkness
pink and blue birth of ocean-sky morning
nearly awake sea-gathered morning on sleeping faces
morning light things of the day taking shape
morning light the open eyes of basket shadows
springing up into colorful cliffs morning sun
morning winds eases the slender moon from the ridge
noon clouds on lava mountains burned shapes
noon clouds a dark spirit shape on lava buttes
noon sun straight down the steep cliff
noon turning low hills into clouds
noon-day sun rolling the fog out to sea the round ball
as night the bump and thump of ocean waves
night lights in the secret cove moonlit sea foam
nights showing us inside mountains
desert lake night enters the blue coolness
climbers effortless the assent of their voices
soft pink hills the hiker invited to rest way over there
in the valley stretched to the setting sun soles of hiker's feet
hikers resting yet the mountain moves its morning shadow
humming "Pomp and Circumstances" mountain hikers
mountain hikers morning as wide as spirit shapes
Sierra hike taking John Muir's word home again
hitch-hiker on the picnic basket several small bugs
hitch hikers a car full of flies going to LA
sun on her knee stuck on raspberry jam dripping through toast
August beaches for moms and crabs the nitty-gritty
teenagers tumbling on the sands over-playful waves
afternoon quiet the grandson's crayon melts on the porch
evening clouds stretched low on the horizon a child's name being called
on her breast brightness next to shadow of lace
ocean foam all night the loveliness of a lace gown
laundry day the gardenia blooms clear white
billowing white filled with a summer day clouds on a clothesline
laundry dries a change of sea wind dampens it again
bottom of the basket the sandy beaches of dirty clothes
home again the mountain that remains laundry
land's end the low star turns into a lighthouse
the lighthouse mirrors over the sea a yellow pyramid
curved rocks looped in the trail a sidewinder
rocky river in its sound a rattle snake
rattlesnake coiled into a spring of rust
flute concert for the finale a rattlesnake claps
downtown Point Arena from trash bin to weed patch a snake
on snake lips two kicking frog legs a snakey smile
arched over the skunk's back stripes of moonlight
spines in the desert tarantula legs
paths crisscrossed by appetites of spiders
wind yo-yo up and down a silken thread breeze-riding spider
a wobbly line of black writing a spider walks by
the spider crawls two legs to the left then three forward
plaid bedspread a small spider playing hopscotch
the quick broom strumming the dulcimer misses a spider
over the mirror in the angel's white eye a spider nest
eating insects at the bird's ankles spider legs
at home in the spider plant one
a rented house for free the swallows build a nest
ocean breezes playing with feathers cliff swallows
light carried in my arms apple blossoms from a neighbor on my doorstep
clusters talking together in admiration apple blossoms
sun transformed into apple blossoms the ground is level
the dam is broken spring cascades into valleys as apple blossoms
apple trees dead white before flowering fuzzy buds
spring sunshine too-early guests wait under budding trees
abandoned orchard desert apple trees bloom pioneer spirits
pea soup lunch out in garden rows planting beans
without rain beech leaves unfolding slick and shiny
knotted fragrance on spring bare branches blossoms
cloud blossoms brush strokes between clusters story-telling branch
silence in the blind wind's dance blossoms
moonlight among blossoming trees a white parasol
that too a present of sour plums on my birthday
feeling older the new calendar doesn't fit the dirty wall
a new calendar my unlived days already numbered
filling the glass with candlelight champagne
champagne bubbles fifty years up my nose
drought year ends with champagne rain
champagne sleep tolling bells ring out the old year
last of the year the ferry boat leaves for another shore
snow it barely covers end of the year
open mouths in the clanging bells end of a year
end of a year book pages stick together
a New Year's friend up the down mountain our flow of words
old year departs on the highest tide in history
cold rolling into a wave last day of the year
last day of the year walking a country lane to the end of it
leap year suddenly on the beach a gigantic wave
New Year's breakfast peeled cold eggs snowflakes
New Year's Day tarnish on the silver mirror fits
threading a needle on New Year's Day the spool unwinds
New Year's Day granola breakfast special with chocolate chips
New Year's Day the warmth of touching dulcimer strings
New Year's Day between clouds the sun a bright beginning
New Year's Day a wind-blown twig writing on snow
wind echo thorny trees sough 'round rocks
desert thorns holding sunset on the summit
thorns summer's afternoon holding still
tearing off yellowed tomato leaves the old woman pauses
tomatoes cooking suddenly it's August I'm six and home
guilt trip summer dead brown trees driving route twenty
sentinel peak the best view watched by the oldest tree
thinking - the oldest trees refuse to cross the river
classical music vegetables rotting in a basket
all those tree fruits and summer vegetables now this child
sea cliff meadow thick with wallflowers unable to hold the wind
water lilies centers of the pond close at night
in still ponds - lilies in their centers - silence the shore - far away
summer's heat swallowed up by the gap in the watermelon
hill meadow mostly upright citizen flowers
wild flower walk greeting the spirits with Latin names
wild flowers the twitter of swallows passing through
shaping petals of wild flowers ocean breezes
from the beach the bottle with a message yellow yarrow
root system of the dried yucca lizard family
green fires zucchini growing with the heat
swollen the amaryllis bud already red
low-slanted sun in the red amaryllis turning on lights
live oaks changing their shapes the fog
leaving the light trunks of tall trees sink into roots
in the clearing hovering a circle of trees their halos
bare trees hidden in purple vapor swollen buds
German gray decorated with snow popsicle trees
wood smoke shaping the radiant bodies of trees in winter
melted snow water trickling over the veins of a dried beech leaf
crossed at the ankles her lovely legs among young birches
birches in the beveled glass winter
snow rain the thin birch branches so very slender
white birches black and white in snow at lava point
a popped balloon breath a breeze again
washing the newborn ties with rainwater cloud to earth
newborn wet with the water unrained
April winds a birth announcement in the wrong mail box
flood waters crest someone by the river puts water in a coffee pot
breakfast coffee the excitement of an ocean in my cup
threads of smoke breakfast fires of neighbors tied together
pale spring sunshine spread over breakfast toast quince jelly
beating egg yolks two yellow butterflies twist in the fog
early morning rain the dry sound inside the cabin of oatmeal cooking
for sale signs yet nobody can own the river
a bit of sky pushed aside the new house
walls of knotty pine raindrops
sound of rain as a dry roof arches
arches splashing rain on a tin roof
raindrops flattening the roof till it shines
running away from four corners of the roof patter of rain
cows in the barn the wet eye in the meadow frozen shut
tall tales of bears on the ridge a garbage can tips
winter day as a hairless bear sleeping sleeping
flying from the branch sun in a bird's wing a shower of snow
blackbirds leaving on bare winter wands pussy willows
winter birds kicking down fireworks from snowy twigs
arranged on bare branches bird songs
bare branch extended by a bird in flight
river clouds clots of black birds darken the sky
a flutter of wings yet the bare branch stays bent
story of a life in a foreign language nut hulls on melting snow
drawing cliffs a black bird the brush
feathered wing tips jagged sea rocks sharp north wind
mirrored in a bird cage a child's face
winter dawn came as the sound of blowing snow sleeping birds
moonset at dawn the sea floor dark and without water
cold moon slipping into the sea the octopus' eye
damp and dim half the moon in the water
scattering bright stars the spent moon sinks into the sea
bending down sea clouds slip free once more the moon
drawn to the porch by the gold of the moon sinking into the sea
a huge white wave the foam becomes the sinking moon
the moon has set a cold smell in the fireplace
shivering the moon sinks into cold seas
moon set a glass of milk to stay awake
Grand Canyon cold to the rim moon snow
moon valleys shimmering in the shadows beads of light
waning the moon comes north enters my window
ebb tide the moon and anemone no longer round
down the highway the waxing moon comes to Half Moon Bay
rising out of the weight of mountains moon and cool breeze
shoreline highway moving over the sea cliff off shore rocks
earthquake in the Thrifty drug store prices fall
beyond the bar dancing lights the sun in the harbor
the hills touching each other at the river
washed hills dribble down muddy waters
painted hills morning freshens the colors
hills mounding up a cloud full of thunder
dirt-poor farmer high on the hill a priceless ocean view
mountain woman cadence of rolling hills in her breast
desert storm from underground hot bubbling water
hot springs not far from the desert sun fire spirits
bubbling hot springs in dry desert sands fire opals
between us hot springs salt water our electricity
hot springs soaking from earth happy bodies
desert nights in the hot springs all the lives
nights in the hot tub dreams
soaked in hot springs crystal-filled waters home in the stars
mineral hot springs all day wearing crystals bare
islands white bones rolled between islands
stars sprinkling in the sea islands
land's end a rock crumbles in damp sand
evening skies in a high mountain lake open to night
nights a window to another world
partly cloudy packing the few things to leave the ocean
summer rains the umbrella also wet waiting for you
vacation the weather report all wet
summer rains drumming your fingers in me
rain stops we sleep still dripping
whisper of rain on a sunny day the surf wets my feet
late summer rain surprising an open window
rain lets up colors come to life with a breath of wind
clouds curved in sea foam rainbows
waterfall completing the rainbow a woman's body
waterfall coming apart rainbows
rainbow hour across the lake mountains of sun
out of a wave rainbows of high tide arching wind
under rain clouds the far valley full of light at sunset
broken rain clouds one sunset slips into another
broken rain clouds slanted sunset light moving mountains
low clouds skirting the mountain a line of white
ragged rain clouds blurring the sharpness of lava peaks
sweeping the porch bright prints of raindrops followed by splashes
desert wash variegated stones speckled with raindrops
two lollipops wrapped in cellophane matching sisters
a noon nap rock shadows restless
picking up sleep where you left it at dawn afternoon nap
roadside rest stop getting out of the car all the tiredness
not really tired a summer day lays down to rest
beach sand measuring a poet stretched out
waking shadows from a nap have moved
slick rock faces climbers' strain against the rope
dots of shadow climbing the mountain flute notes on both sides
to the summit to view the lowest point in the valley
ridge dark in town a good movie
outdoor movies around the old films moths
after the show the smell of rain on hot asphalt
summer afternoon the coolness of white naked on a quilt
moss-green bank the woman reclining nude as is the river
nude beach nothing new under the sun
naked on the porch passion flowers
newborn swimming in the river nude on your birthday
dark waterfall swarms of cliff swallows follow the stream
at dawn white flies into light the sky with a swan
pawing tigers how soft and hairy grandpa' hand
little gray wives a swarm of titmice cleaning the bushes
a picnic the ticks on me also are fatter
companions taking a walk the ticks on me
stream dweller a small gray bird sings water songs
nude beach eyes of water hens floating ahead
desert lake roosting place dark with water chickens
her nest in the eaves in our house we call her our warbler
that hollow sound as the whip-poor-will unfolds itself from sleep
cabbage leaves white worms mate for life
as little as a wren alive as friend the wren is
silence the blossoms dance
a cascade bracken sprouts unroll spring
snowy mountains green shadows of budding birches
mountain curves unfolding in new green birches
white and thin the light of spring where buds dare
budding limbs clouds raked into new trees
without a word each man goes outdoors talks to the bushes
late spring lawn dwarfs disappearing into a leafy bush
shapes of space a flower folded in a bud
expanding the warmth the first poppies in spring sunshine
dizzy at the end of its spiral calla lily whiteness
late spring a dried-up streambed full of lilies
on all four sides of the long-gone shack calla lilies
mountain hollow in the radiance of fog cherry blossoms
hearing bells cherry blossoms shaken by a breeze
cherry blossoms firelight comes down to bare earth
fragrant the sound of cherry blossoms rattled by wind
lace on her Sunday dress cherry blossoms
cherry trees in full bloom he photographs his fat wife
amidst the cherries he photographs his wife the pimple on her nose
cherry blossoms their only warmth cool in moonlight
still beautiful the barren woman admires flowering cherry
a young beauty cherry trees bloom after transplanting
night snows the words on New Year's Day clean and white
New Year's Day at land's end a lighthouse
snow white birds on sea-foam beaches New Year's Day
prosperous New Year the ocean full of whales
New Year's Day meeting the neighbor's smile with cold on my teeth
a mountain of ink spilled on white paper New Year's Day
New Year's Day reading another how-to book with broken glasses
a new year's dream very close to shore a whale blows
together yet telling my New Year's dream to the pillow
New Year's morning the first day begins in the same dream
New Year's Day waking together in the dream
alone at the end of the road a New Year's party
New Year's Eve the angel atop the pine a full moon
New Year's Eve on the country porch the sound of a full moon
the first gong pushed out of the steeple by the second one
New Year's parade in strict formation gulls fly over a lonely beach
New Year's snow a radiance in dark pines white full moon
New Year's Day no resolutions for me I've shoveled snow
days shortened tall pines crowding the year's turn
summer revenge taking zucchini to the neighbor whose lettuce we ate
having an old friend for dinner the largest zucchini
the fire dies among naked birches burned bones
black forest night extinguishes the snow
sun and snow still in the pines the black forest
rusty red the bracken its shape lost as the cold takes the bird's wing
winter bracken frail hands push aside a garden path
after the storm rain covers the scar a branch blown away
whalebone tree limb to rock this child the sun's passing
winter freeze buds of passion flower faint with pink
rhododendron park buds too closed till spring
silence of winter leaves tightly rolled buds
bent cedars facing north all night snow-covered
before rice shoots in paddy ponds the tips of ancient cedars
low clouds bending cedar tips rain
mountain winds from the unseen temple cedar incense
cementing the cedars in place sea fog
rooted in rocks winter rains twist a cypress
sky calligraphy the pruned cypress grown tall
her tinkling laugh dried weeds stiff with ice
thin dune grass weaving winter sunshine warm into the wind
white rim of wild winter seas withered grass
water music sea winds scraping frozen grass
seeds scattered around the evergreen trees a complete circle
mashed thumb out of it flies a purple oath
return of the cold flesh by her thumbnail splits and bleeds
across the canyon the neighbor hammers on an echo
sky blue the faded quilt warm in the rain
cloudy day the pattern in the native rug looks like rain
spring sunshine warming the wool of winter socks
used clothes childhood and peanut butter buying a dress
sun and skin turning cart wheels a young girl
sliver of moon a peeled willow wand in a boy's hand
flickering shadows the way children imitate ballet dancers on TV
rain on the roof reading in the novel of hurrying feet
balance act with a gust of wind a crash of bowls
Tai Chi on the beach one gull watches with outstretched wing
surf sand sinking in human feet
fasting the sunrise brings nothing to eat
the macho man all of his children just like him
on the pier the old farmer tells us how to fish
as the tide ebbs fishermen appear on the sand
ocean fog fishing boats in the sky
evening the river full of fish fishermen
dusk lake sinking into darkness fishermen's voices
gone fishing the fly-specked sign hangs from one corner
thin wet snow the warm wiggle within a cocoon
what dreams holding on one's lap a sleeping cat
dreaming her quivering paws still catching mice
into a windy night the cat takes her cries to be let in
winter's cat all of her wants in my lap
winter stars cat claws in the screen door desperately cold
storm wind in the cat's teeth meowing
cold comes to bed at two the white cat
his dog moves closer the owner quotes a price for land and trees
injured dog all of his words in one eye
the dog scratches as owner his fleas
only vertebrae the found white flowers of a pet dog
a barking dog little bits of night breaking off
dark voices of night bushes a dog barks
a Pekinese barking at Mozart's aria then everyone claps
flying by the wind-swept moon bent pines
spinning out of the mountain's darkness white moon winds
moon wind the full radiance sails from the rippled ridge
pine-needle clusters redrawing the moon each gust of wind
autumn morning a torn shoulder muscle wakes first
eastern peaks autumn stains the morning sky red and gold
first cold dawn using my old straw hat to start the fire
morning dews coming out a cedar house the whole forest
autumn nights filling the wind with other things
night rocks soften disappear
darkness light's last rays lose a name
daylight goes yet we shall stay here where the stars are
world thick slat cabin walls on dark nights
nights light broken into stars neighbor's lights
shore-line nights by waves of darkness the air shaped
river bends into the summer sun autumn's ocean
late afternoon giant boulders dry letting the tide ebb
a line of sea foam the ocean hesitates and then recedes
low tide alone on the beach autumn
a door slams out in the bay a wave collapses
 low clouds pressing the sea
sweeping out to the lighthouse a long sand beach
landslide years slipping away from the cliffs
landslide the cliff reveals its other age
leaving the lake waters calm
valley lake below sea level dried salt
dark blue coolness crosses the lake in ripples
without stars the sky eases pink into the lake
meadow knowledge by sleeping on the ground death isn't bad
foaming between rocks fragrance of seaside meadows at high tide
the stillness between tides meadow fragrance
midnight meadow lying in moonshadows poison ivy
turning the earth as mountains rise they crumble
riverside cliffs the current recycles mountains
jagged blue flames of evening mountain peaks
lost paint box mountains have borrowed all the colors
desert misers in a wide blue sky one low mountain
lying in a meadow kneecap to kneecap with the mountain
desert hoarding mountains
morning mountain top my shadow crosses Death Valley
jagged mountain peaks sharpening my pencil for another scribble
snow mountain lake desert river damned LA toasters toast toast
noon sky red rock mountains jut into blue
hot humid day in a sudden breeze raindrops of wind chimes
wind in a dry riverbed raindrops
towers of rising sun spread over the dark lake wispy clouds
short night colors of a sighing in the wind
painting skies soft hills brush clouds warm colors
evening colors fire rock mountains enter the sky
evening skies the pink of hills rises above them
evening blue shadows from the hills float to the sky
without stars the sky eases pink into the lake
drifting out to sea sky colors warmed in the hills
between the two elms how that patch of blue changes in the high wind
a south wind the yellow cat lies down under a chair
fire-white halo at the moment of eclipse I notice your face
solar dust visible during eclipse all over the room
dappled forest floor the eclipsed sun in a myriad of leaves
under trees a thousand crescent suns eclipsed by leaves
spindrift falling into the sea stars
between stars harp chords stringing unearthly lights
sleepless another bright star descends into sea mist
glass in granite tide pools glitter stars
all the stars at my feet the flashlight wavers
on the nude beach from her tits to her toes it's Saturday night
outdoor flute concert the second movement the wind
singing low sea-white fog disappears in an outdoor concert
following strings stars hum along with the guitar
harpsichord tightened spinal cords jangle
hot summer night all that jazz shared by neighbors
going insane radio rock a block away
stop light music from other cars perfume
in her hands coming out of the hills clay pots
beach clay in her hands palm prints a vase for flowers
how quiet the cove where divers left their trash
dune buggies in the desert night electric fireflies
dune buggies nights in valley lights parked
inspiring view eating cereal with a pencil
row upon row torn from a notebook mountain lines
sea painting a child's water color box full of sand
watercolor paper stopping a wave with a brush
sunlight trying to paint highlights on tops of waves
shades of art deco lying on the beach abalone shells
mouths dissolving rock faces abalone
colors of seafoam in the abalone a cup of fog
tides turning anemone open
designing barnacles foam on the shore of shells
still stinging yesterday's bee dead
bees at the oasis bringing desert sun in to drink
bee lines exciting the air between flowers
a bulldozer the small black bug backs up
breakfast fat lips of baby birds open the day
picnic in the woods papa brings a prize bug to baby birds
morning magic show now you see the baby rabbits now you don't
the ears of a rabbit aglow in the morning sun and down a hole
sunrise on the ridge a white ring around a bird's eye
putting smiles on cherry blossoms photographers
balloon man cherry blooms float on tree-trunk strings
spring sunshine floating among cherry trees gay balloons
ah the exhaled breath of tourists cherry flow-ers
shaming the ladies in bright colored clothes cherry blossoms
cherry blossoms a truck goes by advertising "Wonder Bread"
cherry blossoms permitting picnickers a fragrant lunch
a child offers the cherry flowers a bite
after viewing cherries he blows up a paper sack and pops it
a bee alights on a page of poems cherry blossoms
across the border soldiers and a cherry tree relatives of mine
a spring nap downstream cherry trees in bud
a long journey some cherry petals begin to fall
garden waterfall cherry petals float to earth in the sound
beacon for bees a pink and white fan of cherry petals
the fragrance filling empty lunch boxes cherry petals
waterfalls cherry petals also
clogging the stream the scent of cherry petals in the air
old couple sleeping under trees twined together cherry petals
turning to leave cherry petals flutter around departing guests
in the remote valley spring arrives with hail bruised petals
year of the horse moon and Mars rising together
year of the monkey beginning in New Hampshire national elections
year of the ox yoked together our little jokes
year of the rabbit moving in and out of holes in the garden fence
year of the rat the ad man has designs on Mickey Mouse
year of the sheep the wolf at the door is nuclear
year of the snake a banner waving she's my friend
silver tipped snow deepening fir silence
well-watered the hothouse violet withers
storm seas tearing from sea cliff rocks ice plants
granite boulders footprints from dancing covered with lichens
spaced out tiny manzanita flowers among snowflakes
bouncing out of manzanita bushes hail and blossoms
stronger white blossoms remaining after the hailstorm
resort in winter the black fountains of oaks
wrinkles in hills shadows of crooked branches of barren oaks
all their halos falling in the soup onions
pulling onions sea fog drift apart neighbors come by
red candle holding a bunch of oranges for the winter sun
winter sun wet silk folded in an orange
winter storms as plumes of surf rise pampas grass nods
red-breasted birds among ripe persimmons hiding from the cold
north wind spinning snow blossoms into bare plum
snowfields black pine roots twist a dark stream
scrawny pines all twigs and branches in scanty snow
a crowing crow up the canyon a wind sharp pine fragrance
cliff hanging in a gnarled pine crooked sunshine
alive again morning sun on the dead pine
foreign the fishing boat pushed aside our familiar kelp
the blue boat a hole in the sea filled with fish
Sunday morning a fishing breeze tugs at his tie
fishing green spots in the river catch the light
river edged by the squeak of boots fishermen
surf fishing when they saw our catch beer appeared
tied to the pier the fishy smells of empty boats
fishing in the clear pool a reflected branch
thoughts dangling in the river a fishing line
in the fisherman's pail his gourmet names for small fry
the childless woman fishes with her man bracelets of salt
river fog untying the boat from a long pier
tarnished the silver knife turns red against fish skin
cleaning her nails my husband's lover sells fish
morning light catches fishing boats far out at sea
scattered from lighthouse to lighthouse glow of fisherfolk
sunset dark on the sea fisher boats
low-tide rocks coast dwellers going home with a few groceries
fishermen the one with a pole watches a gull
no guests the fly swatter lies on the Sunday papers
picking up shells ah! there's an old one moon in a tide pool
crunch of bones in the hollow places between the dog's teeth
retreating waves a tiny barking dog has them scared
dolphins arching rainbows of opal light
hands in the light at peace demonstrations the flutter of doves
eagle soars beyond boundary lines a judge on a bench
line of words holding the day we saw the eagle
snow white egrets preen their feathers by cotton fields
nobility wading in up to their knees egrets
an egret the elegance of patience in a tide pool
salt sea the bones of fish crystallized
red winter's dawn trout for breakfast slightly smoked
ripples in water fish spines and mine
mountain moon part of the ice-rimmed pond eyes of trout
scaling fish from the waning moon snowflakes
thawing frozen fish caught in summer
shapes of geese cut from the snowy whiteness nothing lacking
a sneeze in the old sea gull's knobby knees
white surf lining the coast a band of gulls
screaming at the booming surf a band of gulls
silent sea creatures feeding the cries of gulls
passing flock out of a clear blue sky cry of a lone gull
autumn sea fog coming the same way sadness
shorter days the clothesline doesn't reach the sun
a gust of wind earth tosses up a sky of fallen leaves
I'm not old all night my eyes have held ancient stars
a starry night somewhere a windmill creaks as the earth turns
so loud the noise of stars one can't hear the wind
evening star under the dark wings of gulls
autumn storms shaking moonlight from leaves
thunder neighbor with a leaky roof nails faster
before the storm sunset clouds too all mixed up
full storm fury the quarter moon beams down just quiet
such a storm! on the roof are falling all the stars
sea-storm clouds bodies by Michaelanglo ring the horizon
out of storm heavy clouds letting down night
moon halo keep us safe from tomorrow's storm
talk of war unpredicted a storm blows in
sun setting in beach sand blue pits
with the sun ball gone gold pours the horizon wide sky to sea
sunset sky and sea dyed golden from a smallish ball
sea sky line drawing the sun down distorted
tunnel through the mountain's heart headlights
mountain echo ages waiting for its return
desert mountains all four seasons melt into one
desert mountain all four directions meet in one
stone mountain a gravel road winds down the slim edge
mountain pass the setting sun meets the moon
writing on mountain peaks tablets of stone
summit warmth wrapped around by mountains
between mountains desert night wind on a full breast
mountain peaks watching a million years pass by
dizzy wobbly line of mountains at the summit
mountain top silence slammed by a car door
mountain stream bell tones of rocks barely wet
summer at the oasis evening cool
dawn seas the ebbing light leaves shell pink
ocean waves tide sends winds home to the ridge
sea foam blowing from a wild surf gulls
given depth by a passing cloud ocean colors
ocean wild no need to see a whale
summer day the ocean invents aquamarine
holding hands a blazing log -and ocean roar
squirting water between old rocks the ocean plays with itself
crossing darkness of deep space each star
flat sea night faint wake of clear eyes gazing star to star
Venus and the moon in conjunction with my blankets and me
twinkling with laughter stars my old flashlight
low desert campfire a shower of sparks again stars
white water the path to the valley full of stars
a window opens on the midnight sea all the stars
a shower of stars dampened by the roar of a wave
a rim of wild foaming surf crab nebula
high winds stars spinning by in perfect circles
Venus watching you sleep with me
into the sea a shower of stars dark edge of land
night sky so filled with stars gulls do sleep
open window stars drift in on sea mist
stars in a basket broken on white stones
my staring eyes creating in the night sky one star after another
stars scratched in the night light wheels
sunset the show begins with stars
velvet nights the desert wind warm with stars
a blaze out of the big dipper a shooting star
waves following the brush into a watercolor
watercolor class the beach giving lessons in making waves
a Sunday painter the lighthouse just as big as a gnarled thumb
dried up in a box of paints summer sea colors
a hummed tune painting a wave realistic
in exchange for a special rock flute notes
a gentle breeze river willows not moving lost fishing lines
looking up from the crime story passion flowers
as everyone knew poets who write by the sea are all wet
empty desert notebook fills with sand
the book closed yet hearing the poems thunderstorm
green faded ribbon the English lute hangs songs on a nail
sounds of a harp drifting into the forest into birdsong
in rows bees and his lips at harmonica holes
tuning the dulcimer legs of a spider crawling out
birds filled with air fly into it
the tempest returns to a rain puddle a bathing bird
bird feathers in the night sound spring rain
fading the colors of a peacock feather an iris blooms
joined by listening the breath of disciples in baby birds
above the snow at the level of bird song spring begins
from afar a bird's beak opening the gentle air
adding scrollwork to a summer morning bird song
white sparks from a bird's beak the first notes
air of rain filled with drops of bird song
bird call two notes of my pulse
between rocks at low tide bird song
first light in dawn's forest a bird peeps
geometry of birds in the clearing a triangle of call to call
the guru speaks the microphone picks up bird song
bird song nights where you touch me
bird song the wordless poems of early morning
sunset the last light bird song
thunder smashing bird song against the earth petals on the ground
twilight the calls of birds growing dark
blackbirds tying cattails to the sky
not yet spring a blackbird leaves a branch shivering
a fire above sun-warmed bricks cherry petals
pencil poised nothing on the paper but cherry petals
evening clouds tinted pink in clusters of cherry petals
weeping willows over the stream clogged with petals
vacant skies cherry trees bloom all the white light
pale skies cherry trees capture all the white light
tree trunks dark nails hold festival posters cherry time
scarred trunks of cherry trees a bee walks on
cherry tree trunks twisted tapers with white light flower fire
Yoshino cherry trees nodding over a book borrowed from the library
a cooling breeze Yoshino cherry trees in Santa Rosa
lace on blue sky wearing nothing under cherry trees
old man napping in spring sunshine at noon daffodils nod too
mile markers daffodils gone wild on highway one
rejection slip the daffodil remains unmoved
rainy day spilling out of a pitcher daffodil sunshine
sea fog the far meadow dusted with daisies
spring warmth dandelions bloom more suns
in the shade a spot of sun a stray dandelion
under ferns the roar of the creek seeping in
snow-bending pine boughs drifted
crossing to the island pines have arrived before us
deep in the forest the taper of pines brightens the clearing
high principles inner power of pine trees reaching the sky
pine needles sticking into the fog raindrops
moving around the wind in the pines comes home
snow-covered pines Yosemite Falls in white water plumes
wind fury in its shape a crooked pine
shadow of a tall pine sweeping an arch low around the earth
a split rock pine shadow slips in
sighing wind takes from pines their history
spindrift hangs in shore pines moss
wisps of fog writing Persian poetry with the pine
bright red leaves held so high by a winter stem poinsettia
country Christmas under a sprinkle of stars stringing popcorn
rain in the reeds in her mind the river flows backwards
withered reeds all bent one way by ice
even colder the breath of the north wind between broken reeds
meandering stream dark amidst the snow twisted roots
winter willows a vase full of roots rain runs from
the meekness of trees with roots exposed the icy creek
hermit crabs click together after my morning hum applause
looking for shells above the dark sand the sun rose
a box of sea shells finding your letters of long ago
a smooth stone covered with barnacles points homeward
low tide weather salt-stained trouser legs sandy pockets of air
on the beach a broken sea shell thought the forgotten dentist visit
kite string a child's name spoken in a high wind
a kite raising from sea mists rainbow colors
watercolor class the painted blue sky becomes a kite
beach the hermit's kite soaring gulls
flying a kite gulls above the beach stare at the old couple

winter storm landing with a sea gull one feather falls free
sea gulls the sacred script in blue
sea gulls lifting from wild surf spindrift
shadow on the sea a wave forming a gull's wing
a blue heron staring at a blue heron
deep snow the horse walks the paths of summer
a white cloud hanging on the horse's nose to keep warm
riderless horses in the high road sky before the storm
with the thaw buckling the old saddle on a frisky horse
snowbound black and white horses stay in the stall
a white stallion sea fog on snow suddenly solid
high-tide beach filling hoof tracks horses
my new road violated by a horse ridden by a stranger
after days of rain the first sunbeam on the road a galloping horse
riding in waves horse tracks on wet sand scalloping
wet monkey hair organ grinder's tinkley tunes in a cold rain
in winter walls our own mice hoard the warmth
wind moving grasses quick as a mouse stealing seeds
a mouse immeasurable in me
for tired eyes after sunset gentle colors releasing the light
evening sun in that place tomorrow I won't be
sunset moonset leaving alone low tide
summit peaks scraping a sulfur match at sunset
sunset lighting a blaze in a dark fireplace
stumbling the sky at dusk a bruise
sunset painting wet sand purple
wide horizons spreading the colors of a long-gone star
munching gingersnaps desert mountains swallow the evening sun

summer departs the stagnant pond stays right here
alone in the storm anchored to a rocky reef clang of a buoy bell
narrow river opening just a crack the wide ocean
white with foam the ocean enters the river's mouth
reservoir an ancient river refilled
river days a stream of light flows by
river mouth bridged by gulls
redwood roots the river's course bends and twists
deep below running in the sea other rivers
rushing river brushes the air with white ripples
walking the mountains the river goes along with us
mid-morning the river refreshes itself with a little breeze
the earth turns now and then the river bends
hot sun presses water into a river summer flood
from the river winding up the river a stream of cool air
sleeping valley river sounds dream
sleeping below the noisy river the other one
stopping by the river sunlight a bank of fog
rocky stream a dropped feather dyes it blue
sharing the night atop a remote mountain the brightest star
extinguished a candle leaves the night filled with stars
summer night every star also hot
hot night all the stars out naked
counting stars these two small eyes close in sleep
night of stars on her lips his stars of night
twinkling stars splashes of light on dark wet oars
August night the melon moon seeding the stars
riddles the stars answer
woods so still one can hear the stars burning close
storm purple hills grass green hills pinned with a wet blue fence
summer moon feeling our love warm the night

wrinkled hand fists of another grandchild clasp mine
open mouthed amazement seeing grandma clean her glasses
winter folded in grandma's linen closet pure white
unpainted house a crystal in the window coloring the walls
stony sand coming and going winter waves
a crust of snow seaweed flung high by the night tide
storm-tossed waves edged with foam breaking sand
people who die when the sea is full a row of foam
beach pebble round with its years in the making
waves break and foam yet stars
in and out of the driftwood lair gull tracks
beach-blown rainbows in sea foam sand crystals

wind soughs in harp strings chords
melody from the ocean's surface a ripple of harp
another song the drone of a dulcimer rain on a cedar roof
old melody picked out of the air one note at a time
a minuet and you sharpening pencils

bulging within an egg the chick's blind eye
waiting with it one iris withers evening
opening the iris the poem
iris blooming the seventh one opens differently
sky entering the iris as it opens
eyes enter the iris open wide
a breeze bumping blossoms bees
folding paper the faded iris withers

arching the iris opens a rainbow
spreading sepals one more poem opens the iris

iris blooms leaving the clear calyx its purple touch
messages moving without muscles iris fragrance
a blue cup on the table an iris half open
fading the colors of a peacock feather an iris blooms

eyes in secret places deep in the purple middle of an iris
eyes on the purple petals of iris
eyes entering the iris half-closed

her anger painting the iris black the child in her
sea side meadows ocean's lupine a deeper purple
last light the brightness of lupine growing low
home-grown lettuce the taste of well water green
a hill under a cloud of lilac
between the fields a break in the evening mist three lilac bushes
light buried in a bulb lilies
snow melting magnolia buds higher
sunlight taking just one spray of mimosa
two sides of a pond here miner's lettuce there a skim of ice
sea cliff meadows the bull sneezes narcissus
silence columns of earth sprouting new leaves
rotting April snow the refrigerator defrosts automatically
fog rolls in bare windows curtained with sea green silk
seaside house in a sunny corner waves of warmth
incoming tide moving the chairs to the porch
scene from the steeple a field of umbrellas has come to market
breath taking liquid air swirled rainbows in soap bubbles
faint shadows on the earth at eclipse soap bubbles
grandmother's shawl wrapping it about her shoulders she decides to marry
torn silk blown into a mist Bridal Veil Falls
buying a moonstone with a bogus check the wedding gift
wedding ceremony shaping his hand into a club
liver of lamb tomorrow will weed hills of potatoes
earth cools the wood of a smooth handled hoe even song
wild grasses unable to escape the chopping hoe
dawn wind chimes melody by a light breeze
small bumps on wide blue seas whales
stars whales roadmaps
a high hill calls to a whale lighthouse
to sleep where whales deep and dolphins play
bones buried in the backs of whales their hind legs
floating island carrying its own cloud of mist migrating whale
whistling swans birthdeath of a wet year on a green wing
goose pimples seeing in winter many whistling swans
the wild duck as if to shake off frost the moonlight
winter coming around the bend wild ducks
dawn even lighter than snow covered branches cry of ducks
winter fly chased by the rainbows of cut glass
a night howl from deep in a wolf into the dark
tall dead pine the tiny holes of the woodpecker's pantry
a small brown wren trapped in my house I in my realm
undercurrents below spindrift a mellow flute
spindrift above the ocean wave a prayer flag
spindrift a cloud hangs where a wave broke
night fall yet not one stone moves
painting stones a mountain brook moving tree shadows
alluvial fans the valley heat on stone fields
shimmering above the hot stones summer sea
one stone climbing the mountain in my shoe
covered with stones the stream makes a path to the river
fire in the mist rushing down the highway far mountains
mountain path the roundness of the earth arches between my feet
poem maps under summer feet paths
midnight car lining the coast with highway one
headlights on a rain-drenched pass slanted sunlight
yellow line on a black highway last sun rays
desert highway the poet writes a haiku on the yellow line
mountains twisting roads in us
following the river following the sun through mountains
rivers building roads in mountains
desert paths the smell of water paving the way
without moving our road goes from town to town changing its name
heavy thunder dropping down of light rain
thunderstorm yet on the far ridge sunset perfect stillness
thunderstorm in the stovepipe soot falls
old film on remote mountain TV thunder and lightning
quiet now everyone talking about the thunderstorm
twilight some of the light underwater in a white stone
wind time desert clouds blow light into sunrise
desert wind pale blue shadow moving slightly
desert winds blowing mountains into the sun
summer winds lined by the appetites of spiders
rock formations someone in the wind with a fantasy
sunset winds a screen door opens and closes itself
red rock walls the cool wind as wide as holes
curved blue side of the rock of cool winds
warm wind children's voices melt in the night
cave dwellers the grinding stone hollow
bringing home memories of Indian caves
caution: in the petrified forest no smoking signs
harbor town bells on Saturday night buoys
rock woman facing into desert sun her sky-blue eye
Holland flattened against the sky warmed at the edges
Salton sea its blue also covers the far hills
on every road canals with drawbridges for pictures
country villages the sloped roofs huddle against green growing
before their doorways in the hour before darkness people as statues
in the museum yellow flowers floating a glass paperweight
seeing my face in the crowd I bought the mirror
naked breasts wearing only the dark lace shadows of her straw hat
her straw hat asleep by the garden of noon-day sun
eyes closed only my breast to view the sea
off-shore breeze coming to land on bikini bodies
cooling the sand the fat lady's shadow on a hot day
evening deepens the tan on her legs with varicose veins
grains of sand days of a life lying on a beach
silence to seek and wrap around the body nothing
cloud dark joined to sea dark by falling rain
roaring down the beach at the height of winter waves mist clouds
a curtain pulled back by a south wind cold
smooth snow deeper than garden stones the cold
beach cold twisting driftwood into a windbreak
beach cold freezing a driftwood windbreak
winter waves rolling into sun-warmed sand driftwood
waves rolling into frosted sand winter
winter cold finding on the beach an open knife
empty hands our holes in the cosmos
bell-tone circles as path to meditation across galaxies
winter dawn sounds of blowing snow sleeping birds
sea dawn the journey of snowflakes to a parking lot
clouds resting on top of snowdrifts winter dawn
daybreak glass shatters the dream
just at daybreak a drift of snow balanced on each branch
winter dawn comes the sound of blowing snow sleeping birds
falling out at the crack of dawn snowflakes
between mountains and heavy snow clouds daybreak
frozen sun dawn's clouds faint with pink
the skin of our teeth as thick as a life a winter day
daybreak light drifting down in snowflakes
a sermon the deep breathing of a sleeping child
her scarf covering the sleeping face a dream soul net
gnarled knuckles knotting rag rugs for a hope chest
dulcimer chords patterns of a quilt fitting together
spittle strings collecting threads from the new quilt
sunrise string catches colors on the loom
a shuttle hums between strings a deep twang
crippled fingers the forgotten way of making paper
winter drizzle crocheting a blue rug at the door
knitting to farmlands bare trees
weaving a blanket this wood stove perfumes carded wool
knitting to close out the gossip a stitch snarls
a chalk drawing a piece of amber very near pain
stained hands a rag rug crocheting winter's evening
deep in winter the lady lives alone unfinished baskets
foggy morning finds a torn book of poems the patchwork quilt
black buttons under broken baskets bugs stare
before the fire deer hunters discussing cars
old hunter confined to setting traps for mice
fibers so fine mornings green the air
before it comes the knowing of rain in the air
sea air each cell fills with salt water
morning air tightly rolled in her curlers
morning breeze coming in the window surf sounds
clouds the sky divided into puddles
waves churning up high clouds
clouds touching the sea with rain
free to fly some of the ocean in wind-driven colors
wispy clouds splashed across the sky sea foam
a point of land breaking through the clouds sunshine
pines under great white mountains clouds
changing forms all around the Buddha clouds in a blue sky
clouds flooding the river with spring
spring cloud melt flooding river willows green leaves
clouds flooding the river bubble sounds
spring floods the river valley in high spirits
cloud sound the river flooded without a duck
bridging the flooded river my fears
up-canyon winds rushing flood waters the wrong way
carried along with the flooded river muddy thoughts
white pussy willows above a muddy swollen river fat raindrops
flood waters filling on a deserted island a wine bottle
spring comes to the river flooded
glub glub the flooded river drinking stones
all the noise of a spring-flooded river back in the wind
spring floods the river valley up to my toes
spring floods grasses on a high hill lowered
swollen stream flowing sideways into fence rows
blue into blue flood waters rise in a pool of iris
rising flood waters tonight's moon is less than yesterday's
flooded delta in the rocks many cracks
eventide desert mountains flooded with pink
desert sounds out of the sun clouds moving
rippling grass wind moves up the hill light waves
coastal hills from curling waves a new green
autumn storm the neighbor closer by a bare tree
from the wind the flute lesson of a bare tree
a frosty night in all the trees such a letting go
autumn the bloodless wounds of farewell and leaves
touching a tree in palm the sound of its bark
picking berries the brown bear of a neighbor
autumn sun lying in brown bracken both of us
mountain spring a fall of fern in autumn
leaving new friends to return home among dried sword ferns
higher education from the school yard these two buckeyes
an old friend chinquapin burrs open on smooth fruits
cactus patch enlightenment comes with getting the point
at the point of enlightenment holy cross cholla
chestnuts we gathered as they warm the memories of Italian sunshine
meeting an old friend chestnut burrs pressed in our folded hands
howling sea winds Christmas carols sung by the local choir
Christmas a sleigh draws homeward all my thoughts
coming ashore on Christmas Day pure white waves
Christmas in the driest places desert holly
Christmas day a waiting at the roots of pine trees
Christmas dinner still warm two crows by roadkill
covered with ice the picnic table on Christmas Day
Christmas Eve a life time of habits not sleeping
Christmas Eve out of the sea storm a lighthouse
Christmas Eve sea rocks unmoved by the storm
Christmas Eve out of the dark hail
Christmas Eve hail "Peace on Earth"
Christmas Eve the batteries left on all night
Christmas Eve only star a foghorn
holiday ridge points of candlelight and stars
 Christmas lights shining in the sun
 Christmas lights in the thick pine forest
Christmas play afterwards all the stars on the school bus
Christmas gifts what to buy for someone dying
cash crop Jesuit priests peddle Christmas trees
Christmas tree out cleaning the room for spring
in the corner where the Christmas tree gloried crooked chair shadows
glacier rounding rocks now a woman
under low clouds evening sky glacier cools the wind
a journey ends where the glacier melted a field of stones
granite without shadow edges ice on black water
clouds leaving their shapes in hills
winter rain brushing wild hills a faint green
low winter light hoarded in red hills at sunset
crystal waters warmed with the scent of earth
ancient earth tiredness of my old body in hot springs
winter stars warmed in mineral baths foggy
dreams from hot mineral baths a bright lava flow
winter night joining us in the bath foggy stars
silence ice all by itself squeaks
crystals designed in dark cold time ice cubes
out of a rock water flows with history rimmed with frost
icicles hang yet above my face her naked breasts
windless days surrounding the islands in deep sleep
winter morning surf brings to cold sand a ruddy glow
tapered the knife lies in the river an island untouched
red and black jasper and obsidian from a volcano
jasper volcanic gift of healing from earth fires
fire spirits gift jasper nuggets
twilight neither night nor day frogs and bats
abandoned theater the moon spotlights a frog-prince
in the shallows a child learns to swim by frog eyes
frogs sitting in the river all of us
creaking voice frog joints as stiff as mine rainy days
pond ripples heartbeat of a frozen frog warms again
a new puddle frogs joining old star light
frog silence pond shadow in my ear
monks chanting only at first are they still temple frogs
frogs naming the first stars aloud
quiet waters frogs all listening to my shower
leaping into the river the frog watches me still as a rock
floating the moon the silver tide of grunion ride on the beach
sea gulls soaring above cliffs freshly painted
morning light from dark rock crevices gull wings
rounds a sea gull circles surf songs
high winds blowing gulls into blue-white
ebb tide shells walking into the sea hermit crabs
a hermit crab having for breakfast someone else
borrowed shell taking home a fluted whelk and hermit crab
spring morning finds a new sign on every leaf
leafing trees in evening's purple glow no longer bare
filling a spring-flooded river new green leaves
edges of oak extended by new leaves bright as blossoms
sea wind pushing up the mountain new green leaves
pale light cool in the dim forest new leaves
planting onion sets the roar of surf that much louder
onions planted pushed into soft earth bombs in Libya
pansies in a canning jar baby photos
peeping through snow the folded up faces of pansies
winter ends a row of peas covered with earth
plum blossoms the smell of white sheets with white...
plum blossoms a fragrance in the air star-shaped
plum tree remembering us that time
plum tree throwing off its bareness pure white perfume
where sleep the birds with dry feathers a white-plum night
primrosed the spring sun among green leaves
days measured by wild primrose clocks crocus calendars
in the mailbox a bunch of radishes from a neighbor
roots of radishes sand caught in tiny hairs her laughing lips
gone fishing the only takers pussy willows
a summer shower the asphalt road rising in steam
beach road summer smooth from sandy feet
a mountain bends in the road heaped high
mountain road going and going and yet time stands still
freeway a truckload of art passing tanks
dust the road disappears in itself
road winding around the mountain mountain views
down from the pass still the black road wiggles
in the stream waiting for wind ripples to move the mountain
this beach stream hangs our sandals on two fingers runs to the sea
an open window surf sounds square
night surf the bright waves of flame
surf's boom sun beats into water sound on metal
earth spins surf sounds in dry sand
boiling seas into a wild surf a hot sun
black cypress draining into the swamp strands of color
home again a pulse of tides in our blood
tilted this side of the ocean dries in the sun
dry rocks bubbling up between the incoming tide
incoming tide the sun-dried rock wetted
rattle of rocks at high tide the stars an earthly tone
night tide black rocks blacker as a dark moon
tanned except for the places a fly sits
bodies given to the desert sun
hot bathed body dried by desert stars
sun-bathing conservationists saving water
evenings drawing closer to the fire sun-burnt faces
green waves florescent with surfers in mod wetsuits
sleeping in the sun only surfer dreams ride the bright waves
surfers black suited among seals
rationed water in the desert our wet places
bright blue armpits the indigo blouse fades into a hot day
beach day evening turning flesh to fire
lumbago's dull pain a summer breeze frisks by the bed
feverish on a hot day defrosting the refrigerator
summer colds the neighbor's dog barks when we cough
on one hand the liver spots of aging poison ivy
churning seas love-making in the hot tub
making love into hot tub foam falling stars
an undriven nail caught in the lighthouse at land's end
between our legs dancing flames in a fire place
log to ashes clocks our love-making
after the tryst the red candle gutted yet  comes sunrise
snow by candlelight brightens the turn to shorter days
for tall folks the hours of light shortened
slow rains as if leaves were falling at winter's end
first light nudging frozen clouds snow flakes
star gazing all the familiar things in morning's light
milky dawn the world without color takes form
spots of blue varying the light to fit tracks in the snow
morning light a couple on the cliff as spirits of a new day
just now the moon set and you sleep
timeless in the fog someone walking
foggy night farmlights of a lonely coast separate
wrapped in fog colors of the coast quiet
fog edge of the cliff edge of the world
ocean fog in the broken sign "open"
fog the days go by without hours
evening fog in town with dampened spirits
mist broken from night waves sleep
asleep fog extends the morning
foggy morning coming in the door weak sunlight
thick swirling fog not seeing anything just a wing shape
snapped! caught in a mousetrap a night's sleep
a broken mirror now the ice breaker pushes apart the joys of skating
in the 'fridge the dark chocolate with the door closed
the young boy refusing to build a snowman
incense burns inside a moon shell whorls of smoke
knots in wood temple walls echo a gong
monks slow song of evening chanting stomachs growl
tantra monk chants the mouth nearest mine breathing
monks chanting the crooked pine wind straightened
sun moves over rough-sawn planks monks chanting
one bowl koan Zen students laugh and lap it up
earth-loosened ascending heaven monks chant
earth heavy chanted prayers ascend into high humming
lessons stars during the day still there
alone in the forest closing one gate opening the other
tapered prayer a lone pine points into heaven
Zen garden patterns raked by falling rain still the dust
stiff from sitting how welcome the fire of crooked branches
a flute concert the cat breathes gently through her whiskers
soprano solo measures the cathedral's highest praise
organ recital loosened soot falls free in the stove pipe
piano concert by firelight the flickering of notes
still standing where others lived abandoned cabin
dusting the dresser a gown which shared our passion
death the star sailor home again
as dreams wood in an iron stove falls into ash
tree roots bones of the dead leaving earth
a carved name smelling of bone marrow round and white
last days as thin as her skin loose on bones
people who die when the sea is full a law of foam
silence between old folks no longer breathing
tracing the blue veins on her breast winter
baby's ancient face wrinkled and sexless grandparents
touchstone the body arching the abyss death
antique mirroring on TV gone with the wind
bored by winter wild surf waters knot sea grass
bored with winter a beach walk finds abandoned toys
journeying spring clouds blow over packed suitcases
rolling down rounded ridges rain clouds
a cloudy day the silky softness of fresh-washed hair
spring winds between the tops of bent grass bottoms of clouds
silence in high winds a cloud turns around
wispy clouds a white-water view of the sky
the pyramid morning fog and sun slanted by redwoods
treetops green leaving in fog clean blue
a winter heart flying into spring low clouds and fog
sunrise pouring into the valley fog
cliff side the edge of fog bright green
step by step a hole in the fog walking away
moon radiance filling the river valley fog
sea fog darken the trampled grass beach path at dawn
on the green hill piles of dark clouds full of hailstones
after lovemaking hail falls between us she buttons her blouse
a hazy moon pinpointed by the lights of fishing boats
silence wafted by light many colors
a range of light morning colors flow out of the high Sierras
hill rise trees lending themselves to the land
high tides sea mists in coastal hills new green grass
blue veils badly wrinkled - barely smoothed rows of coastal hills
surf rolling morning sunshine into green hills
coast hills one dark rainstorm leaves a green shimmer
the spring lake rising up to sit on the bench
ripples the lake ear listening to us
skystone dropped by a mesa a light shine
after the storm small waves on sea meadows meek sheep
flute melodies across green ocean waves spring meadows
the bones the stones the last snow melts again a river
coming between trees slanted sunshine rivulets melting snow
soul shape between soft evening peaks a valley cradle
coastal mountains catching the rain clouds wet slopes
rising at 6:00 am a wobbly blue line of distant mountains
morning air the mountain smells as if it had slept
up the mountain on the yellow line someone goes down
mountains folding into a valley bird wings
sunshine on the way to your house a muddy road
desert oasis finding in the water more "o" sounds
trickle life in a granite wall water
floating clouds down from the mountain a puddle of rain
falling down the mums not picked because you are gone
autumn rain above the dialysis machine a withered mum
frost-tipped mums gathered in withered arms with black sleeves
all in black she stoops to save frost-tipped mums
chrysanthemums with them in the room I cannot close my eyes
fall fashions the tweedy patterns in cotton fields
canyon crevice out of red rock water flows into a golden tree
cottonwood in the leafless limbs starlings
autumn evenings cottonwood trees seem too cool
cottonwood trees the dry sound of rain along the river
at the oasis wearing the coolness of willow and cottonwood
late rains high in a river tree autumn gold leaves
river of gold sunning with cottonwoods Virgin River
harvest moon a bulging corn crib releases it
small weeds finding shadows for the night
autumn down the length of tall grass
dried weeds a nameless spider loses his shadow
wild squaw grass wind twining the slenderness with shafts of sunlight
withered grass a crow stretches his eye over hanging heads
ridge top burnished grasses the monk's pate
Christmas day near-by a squirrel poses on a greeting card
snow falling the long awaited letter on its way
letters written with a thick nubbed pen storm trees
Christmas ornaments bought that year we didn't come home
Christmas ornaments last year's dust wrapped in tissue
unwrapping Valentine gifts naked
brand new Valentine's gift herpes
married in the cold month sea foam freezes on the rocks
my white Christmas only under the branches of the snowberry bush
winter solstice the white night alone with rolling surf
winter solstice the sun in the south with old folks
south sun December's horizon rolled in fog
winter solstice the sun at its own birthday party
for winter solstice bumpy as an orange moonset
winter solstice warmth of friends return the sun
winter solstice greeting like souls the sun returns
winter solstice a white eve alone with a wild surf
a glare of ice to walk without a path the frozen lake
snowstorm dropping white skies into a lake
the lake thawing an image of a woman awaking
tufa towers reflecting in the lake volcanoes
sunrise burning in the salt sea a pillar of light
fire spirits underwater architecture comes to light
winter-bound peaks the snow not melted by our gazing
snow-capped peaks sun setting fires with fog-smoke
out of snow sun sets mountain peaks a fire
snow-covered sweet water mountains rising upward
mountains folding in the sky blue snow shadows
north wind guardian of the narrows bares the trees
without a guardrail the tumble-down place where cars go over
faults folding mountains unfolding history
nothing to wear just clouds covering mountains
as in the sky mountain snowfields trackless
mountain cabin a wedge of winter sunlight pushes in the doorway
closing the mind the sameness of gates mountain passes
snow blowing far from the ocean an aching ear stuffed with cotton
arctic snowfields blow across sky-blue waters white caps
where the sun sank a ship sails cool on western waters
winter sun waving the ocean's brightness a blue-white flag
taste of butter heifers in the meadow sunshine flowers
spinning mobile home to hummingbirds unmoved
humming bird wings the rhododendron blossom that flutters
waiting for the wave the killdeer practices his cry of surprise
curtains calico with kittens
twin lambs newborn in the wide meadow stand touching
evening climbing a gentle hill lamb and mother
the cry sleet turning to snow a newborn lamb
sheep folds squeezing out a newborn lamb
parting fog on wind barren meadows birth of a lamb
rivers to the sea bending with the songs of meadow larks
shell-veined breast of a lark swelling sea cliff meadows
soaring the bird out flies its name
bubbles larva in pond scum fly away
cold wind on the beach only limpets feel at home
whispering welcome to our winter-weary selves returning geese
goats to be milked lower under heavy skies bucket cloudy white
minnows rippling river sand two-year old toes
spring minnows patterned by fallen leaves
a point of land out in the river a minnow
cloudy dawn on my pillow moth wing dust
in a mouse nest one pink nose on a cat
spring floods tiny fishes swimming by a bird's nest
bed springs creak by snow-melt freshets a redbud branch
far from malls city women in the woods pick rhododendron
It's May the somber pine forest pink with rhodies
mountain bouquet the whole forest full of rhodies
raindrops opening rhododendrons at dusk
outdoor shower rhododendrons stare at my nipples
leave the laundry rhododendrons can be our bright colors
chattering visitors finally silent before the rhododendron
fog the first rhodie fades
after blooming the rhododendron bushes sink back into the woods
root circle a pool of water growing in a tree
dark soil pushed from a seed a blind root
spring rain a dance with tiny steps of tree roots growing
white rose petals transparent in the night sky a not-round moon
fragrance tied in a knot rosebuds
curling painted roses where the roof leaks
a field of safflower there at the top of the hill leaning on the sky
dead cypress in its wind-shadow saplings
freshly washed hair receding tide leaves wet rocks
high and low tides weaving sand
the tide turns a whoosh of wave splashes white
pictures in the burning wood tide lines
rippling light night tide flows back to a sunlit sea
high tide sharing a small beach with wet feet
melting in a tide pool sun on still waters
deep in the earth tremors in our knees magnified
after tremors in the fear and trembling frog voices
rocks crumble into valleys evening colors
deepening the lowest point in USA night shadow
jagged mountains the wide slope of valley smoothes the air
mountain shadows tracing valley contours across the sky
layers of color the cliff eases into valleys blue dusk
San Joaquin valley: sand walking valley after all my years
Queen Valley* mother earth full of gold
empty night sky fills the desert valley with city lights
the breaking wave cough drop colored cool mint
between rainclouds sunlight slants deep into valleys
mountain greatness the gentle easing into valleys
rainclouds blowing into the valley sunset's golden light
bell tones of the country side village names
ocean waves pound the tattoo on his arm blue skin
the rocky river our knees a buzz with the current
swimmers afternoon heat underwater
salt crystal ripples washing shells on my feet toenails
sitting in the river rhythmic waves between my legs does it for me
taking heat down from the ridge into the river
hills and valleys a woman lying flat in the river
an old woman swimming the August stream the mossy smell
catching the big one a fat old lady hauls out on the nude beach
swimming alone the drag of undertow mom calls
tea house fresh air fills the cup with green tree
date groves palms waving at single tourists
bound by a bell strangers in the street of ancient churches
good for the tongue names of Norwegian home-cooked food
sidewalks of Paris the smell of coffee on a foreign tongue
nasal tones long bread under dark blue elbows
tourists at sunset in canyon walls a sea of red eyes
closed in sleep all the eyes seeing the canyon
tourists still keeping alive ghost towns
dry river bed round rocks moving into tourist's cars
airport parking lot bubble gum sticking to me my home town
new flannel gown wrapped for the night in thick sea fog
fog river mouth bridged
worldly view obscured by sea fog angel wings
fingers into valleys sea fog
warming thick fog a fire
out of fog fog colors in waves
into the cove fog pours more secrets
cutting out the world sounds of the sea fog
erasing the land the ocean sends a blanket of fog
neighbors leaving as fog
frost dropping a basket with 12 eggs
lace edges the fallen leaf white with frost
granite patterns fallen to leaves frosted rust
flowers blooming on dry sand and pond frost
water over ice floating among clotted leaves a face expiring
surf sounds covering the winter porch a shell of ice
clouds still in the mountain brook ice
before they melt hailstones hiding themselves in the gravel path
spindrift falling on the hills hail
the oiliness of earache medicine organ music
organ recital the cherub over the altar sways in time
church organ music wondering if my tampon will hold it all
high tenor voice carries into a vaulted arch my tears
harp notes sewing the hem of winter's robe
madrigals humming in pine walls winds
soprano's aria a cavity in my tooth fills with pain
flute concert salt water crashes into silver spray
flute concert blown from foggy skies silver drizzle
madrigals from the 15th century rain continues
Christmas carols the Buddhist convert hums along
in notes from the harp stringing together evening hours
singing old songs the surf rolls on the sand its roar
winter room warmth of a string vibrating old songs
desert wind composing a flute concert in pine wood
deep at sea wind in the harp of whale songs
with the harp the whole house hums a windsong
closing his eyes his horn finds the blue note
plucking the strings frozen flakes fall far from the harp
imported a German zither snowflakes
Saturday night in the widow's cabin dulcimer music
another rainy day cleaning out of the toaster crumbs
silence around the old couple all their repeated words
silence faces at the party in a mirror
after hours of conflict white waves no longer mount the black rock
blank book eyes filled with waves and wind
cold the room when the last of the ink has been written
without a lamp the moonlight turns my hair white
black ink the many poems dye my hair white
spilled wine finger prints on the glass shaking
young at heart still the roses fade on her nightie
a haircut less white on this old woman
winter road a sharp turn to the nursing home
gaining weight the world thicker with snow
winter leaving another blue vein on her leg
first snow I'm not one year older anymore
gazing at her photograph the glass reflects an older face
painted silver her wrinkles mar the smooth glass
fifty years not remembering which toothbrush is his
aging beauty truth lies on the mirror reversed
winter so cold the sun leaves earlier each day
midnight room rays of candlelight star-cold
night cold surf's surge and boom in the bathtub
morning light the sound of waves on your sleeping face
without lights the brightness of a blue sky full of stars
dawn's faint hour squeezes in heart-run veins light in every limb
light touching where only rain goes trespassing
tides light comes and goes as ocean
first light the cove still dark with low tide
dawn light rocks and water full of fire
wings of dawn birds unfolding the light
the dark moon pulls out of the ridge morning light
stars bend down morning seas light dawn
ocean so wide and weighty yet dancing with light
sunrise out of two feet comes eight foot long shadows
crack of dawn the thin line of birds peeping
curving an ember of a not space place crack of dawn
morning waves to burnished water a radiance
ancient cypress leaning over the light at sunrise
morning bright meets cabin cold on quilted mountains
as is the dark without the sound of rain the room grows cold
April weather all the changes leave us cold
spring presses cold into shadow shapes
curve of the sea cupping her breasts cold hands
no April Fools these crocus buds closed against the snow
the guru speaks evening steals upon us with wide-open eyes
stained glass above the baptismal font a babe spotted red
canning jars overflowing among the graves roses
Easter bunny leaving a basket of kittens
Easter Monday finding a solid chocolate egg under fake grass
earth day my pencil bounces as a tree falls
high mountain village church organ reedy as willows the noisy brook
telephone call the addressed Easter card| not to be sent
Easter morning mountain my shadow crosses Death Valley
Easter Sunday hikers arrive in Cathedral Canyon
after the storm a sunny Easter morning finds opals
atheists' vacation Easter weekend in Death Valley
Father's Day he names his son after me
late again joke gift-wrapping popcorn for Father's Day
Father's Day she mows the lawn and whistles
Good Friday buying Easter candy the second time
she lifts her head a tapping at the window is only rain
rain opening the window a light heart
a south wind polishing my face clean for this journey
spring winds the old lady tries again to tidy her hair
spring mists on these long evenings someone's coming
an unknown boat coming into the harbor touches me
walking to work our sleeves touch starch on silk
asking for a ride his answer dotted with music
static electricity garbled introductions they lean together
panty hose she crosses her legs with whispers
woman and her pillow curled around a notebook dawn's first light
light imprinting the stone rings
as one of us the child watches an earthworm
warm under quilts the young couple lie quiet in the place of one
rain drops falling around the bed her hair pins
his body a bow his arrow shot me full of flowers
in mud puddles in a strange sky over a stranger land
rain drops in a puddle crowns of light jewels
skystone rounding the matrix a puddle
in puddles the pattern of raindrops dyes the hills green
light winding through the forest a river
rocks twist the river smoothes each one
evening skies dark comes to the river cloudless
light drawing in the river boulders
low clouds squeezing earth into a river
streaming in morning light electrifies the river
river wind from valley to mountain top dampness
after the shower the smell of pine soap in the forest
pencil a color of trees wet with rain
"Dear Mom" her letter on a driftwood stick washed out to sea
the way! the ocean arranges driftwood logs on a deserted beach
driftwood bright with burning stars
Sunday visitors admiring sculptured driftwood in the town square
high tide the secret script of driftwood writing itself
driftwood silver sea mists petrified
on the island no one goes to driftwood
falling down all sides of the mountain leaves
nude in the river a dirty old leaf touches my thigh
very drunk bright leaves fall into a heap
a gust of wind tossed back into the sky fallen leaves
in frozen mud the imprint of a long leaf lying somewhere else
on the ground leaves from one tall tree three inches deep
a swimming hole filled with the cold of fallen leaves
drawing boats on each leaf ribs in water
heavy clouds winter solstice brightens lightning
after the solstice cleaning the house trimming wicks
winter solstice finding a new point for acupressure
winter solstice so low in the trees its return just stays
Christmas gifts wrapped in white tissue mist-covered mountains
wrapping gifts a whale swims by covered with barnacles
winter white on the ocean's block of blue melting crust of foam
storm-washed sea each flat wave a dirty gray
pounding the beach with storm wild waves the foghorn
storm waves falling from angel shoulders sea spray
all night the sound of waves purple silk
cold winter ocean warms spindrift in the sun
winter ocean tossing spindrift over the cliff into morning sun
curving waves sleep carries us away all night
wave songs pound upon eyelids sleep
dark blue lines in a salt sea dreams
sea ironed black stars hang at the edge of winter
ocean waves and things that sleep so words can hold them still
kneading dough silent in the window wild surf rolls
sea winds a rush and noise learned from water
silence between crashing waves white foam
a flow of snow returning the wave foaming surf
winter waves playing tag with old folks
winter waves crowning plumes of white spray
a sunny corner all the winter winds in white waves
seaside town emptied at night by a roaring tide
nest filled with spring time eggs
forming eggs the roundness of a breast in a nest
silence around a bird the nest
lady carpenter by her house the bluebird builds her nest
within a shell eggs laid warm in a hollow nest
shadows hatched nightingales in morning light
oyster barbecue a mother of six watches the pile of shells
moving into the sun the pony takes with him some mountain shadow
feeding her ponies all of her stories the precious hours
the pony's path good luck signs each step
spring winds running over the pasture lift the pony's tail
free puppies' eyes in dirty store windows filmy blue
ebb tide a young puppy searching for place to pee
blushing a bit the rising spring sun on the robin's breast
at the bird feeder robins fighting over wives
she doesn't notice a child with the doll carriage the mother robin
a robin sings as if it was he who planted the garden
a rooster crows by just that much the day is longer
tiny salamander a look as long and ancient as your mating
silence from a sea shell a heart's mirror
a whorled shell pale ear pressed in sand surf sounds
in one sky x-ray photos of sea shells wet wisps of fog
sea lions bark and then turn back the sea is pink
transplanted saplings from the far ridge all these thoughts
between rain showers the slanted rays of the scotch bloom
escaping spring tangled in sea weed a sharp smell
blue sky held by still wet laver leaves held by a rock
under the earth newly planted seeds part of the moonrise
seedling larger by a drop of water caught on its leaf
an arched back the seedling bursts into the light
shepherd's purse growing as high as my hip pocket
bending low a heart leans to the soil picking strawberries
early morning vine tendrils curl and hold the day still
river veins and tree root muscles green leaf skin
trees held together upright white pillars of light
silence in wood between the growing rings
everything green yet some trees naked with moss
cold light of day it makes the trees stop night whispers
evenings setting the sky on fire lava mountains
red into black summit passes into sunset
mid-day heat of volcanoes still in the rocks
lava rocks flowing with the river night-long shadows
lava rocks flowing with the river dry summer heat
black lava pushing into bloodred sunset peaks
sunshine the tops of waves melting into hard metal
sun in front of each crested wave its own radiance
night air breathing deeply the waves wet dry sand
walls of water waves in rock a tearing sound
waves crash in the curve of the bay unbroken by man
wave upon wave sun beats the water into a hard curve
earth turning a wave rounds the blue green
elephant rock stomping on the beach ocean waves
asleep yet waves remember to come ashore
a wave breaks out in laughter two people
waves unrolling seafoam
mounting up a wave rides a rock ashore
rolling in waves the white foam clouds thunder
solid waves flowing into the surf dunes
arching into the sky the wave takes on more blue
teary eyes seeing with binoculars salt waves
going home car doors close out the river
going down the road rocky river rhythms in our legs
lost eyes on the map miss the turn
mid-morning hunger driving right past the chocolate hills
freeways car motors cursing
granite boulders rolling along the roads tiny tin cars
driving home the wrecked car still there
a trip with maiden aunts coming apart
after traveling the hot tub filled with strangers
sea side darkness leaving the city bright not-knowing
dancing in bed next to the nightclub motel sleeplessness
Grand Canyon so very huge no room in the inn
desert vacation the first day back into a mountain stream
stars in the hot tub two on vacation
for rent on the door magic runes
rented windows 190' of ocean view on Mastercharge
window to window oceanside vacationers eyeball to eyeball
roadside bench everyone drives right on by
sea escape the cliff house hangs out in space
between two views of the sea a color TV
six o'clock news we turn to watch the world of a picture window
my bare legs on the stranger legs of chairs
shutting the door not shutting out surf sounds
veiled moon fragments loosen hail
silence after the hailstorm cold
jingling coins deep in his pocket the moon slides behind clouds
cold the winter moon with you at the window
full-moon sky cold high winds blow from a bright hole
waning moon watches a pie put out to cool eaten away
dark night winds blowing over the seas the moon sinks in
the full moon slips into its silver path sea sleep
melting into the sea the full moon leaves a candle bright
plunging right in the moon and I cold night seas
time on a moonless night a dog barking
released from snow-capped peaks a full moon
cold winds rounding snow-capped peaks a full moon
from the full moon cold summit winds snow-clad
touching eyes the whiteness of snow a full moon
winter moon directing the winds around corners
winter's new moon the cutting cold shines tonight
high on a cliff the quarter moon finds dark houses
rented house harp hollow cold
lamplight the room seems empty without zither notes
going out to pee he gives it a shake hurries back to the fire
outdoor plumbing with a shower of snowflakes soap bubbles
winter nights thawing pipes taking a leak
stars watching me shower with snowflakes
starlight all around the shower snowflakes
clean feet on redwood steps a pad of snow
freezing an outdoor shower snow-caked soap
more white in washed-wet hair snowflakes
winter storms dinner by candlelight every night
computer software reading the new manual by candlelight
lamplight how small the room without power
cheese sandwiches warmed on the wood stove where soup cooks
yuppie neighbors with central heating around the cookstove
without power the snap sound working in a mousetrap
haiku poets too chop wood carry water when the power's off
after the fasting the bitterness of salt speaking again
castle of light a spiritual pattern on the path
book of poems on each page fingerprints of a soul
breathing underlining sentences in a book
down from bookshelves ancient myths come to life thick ocean fog
lying in bed cold beside my sleep wide awake
a new winter friend up the year's steep sloping our flow of words
your poem the brief language of footsteps
bird song under winter quilts bodies touching
together your tip glows as incense burns
seaweed tied in knots ashore in winter storm we stick together
necking the never-ending story movie forgotten
telephone call your smile in a space you've never gone
curved ink the warmth of your hand in the letters
charmed a sunny day in winter a new you
ice melting her hand touches his
a glow the whole candle a flame
angels dreams on your face my eyes
appearing me in your dream you in my...
uplifting light hearts magic
this vow written so deep in dreams
their eyes as a priest raises the wine blood rushes to her cheeks
evening alone only pine mountain my guest
northeaster storm yet feelings of longing dare the cross winds
quilt patterns the full moon's path of my desire
desert silence between us cold at night
waiting for you the dull swish of my raincoat
pines bowed with snow my longing
still cold spoons in the sandbox all empty
shining glass of unlit kerosene lamps this long evening
expanding the warmth the yellow flowers of longer days
old snow soften by bird song a longer day
a long day unfolding rock crevices with light
the long day holding my eyes against the sky
rocks give way morning light rolls over eastern peaks
morning drawing lines on the sea one for the horizon
morning wetted by the light splash of small waves
morning side of the mountain awake
early morning the weight of paper waiting for poems
ocean terrace lifting to the north-born fog morning
morning light dreams climb the dark wall of the obelisk
yawning sea fog in the valley rolls into morning
morning sun pulled over the ridge by sleepy eyes
morning sun coming down the cliff the ocean night
morning fire blazed forth at last sun through the fog
a morning moon your face in sleep turned to the wall
a calm sea refusing to accept the morning moon
Graduation Day sweat and mothballs grass so green
graduation where green banners wave grass grows long
graduation night the owl printed on a balloon seems the wisest
gun salute from a hilltop monastery monks chanting
religion on the remote coast buoy bells
May day removing her wedding band the last cloud
Memorial Day so many flowers broken off on the ground
Memorial Day wild flowers overpower the flags
cloudy a crowded sky Memorial Day
Memorial Day the passion flower opens wholeheartedly
Memorial Day the honored guests slept through the parade
Mother's Day giving the old cat a dish of cream
Mother's Day the daughter's call about her divorce
Mother's Day wearing the silver earrings from Mexico
Mother's Day deciding the cat must be spayed
Mother's Day all of her flowers bloom along the road
Mother's Day the photo of her afternoon
Mother's day give-away puppies escaping the banana box
Mother's Day seaside restaurant special crab balls
wearing of the green for a real Irishman a black & blue eye
during the hailstorm the stuffed Easter rabbit clutched in her arms
last day of frost buying the bride a bread box
spring storms at their climax thunder rolls away
rain shower afterwards he reads to me all of his poems
eyes into eyes lights
after lovemaking all is quiet until rain begins again
a woman's cry the shower begins with lightning
orgasm an explosion of flowers in wind chimes
tangled in sleep on a sea weed strewn beach lovers
flooded river sides flowing together lovers touch
dripping spring rain and your body in mine
driftwood lair lovers hidden from view found by the wind
lying in a river words of love in the current
rain idle fingers strumming the dulcimer
one ear listening to the river wet with rain
rain dripping one hour into another
these long days watching the sky fade with closed eyes
river winds flipping white pages without poems
rain erases time one hour reused the whole day long
in this rain my house a stone in the stream I a female fossil
scattered among driftwood drifters
touching his face the slope of her forehead echoes
new friends meet snow-melt streams into the river
walking the river comes along too
river sound its shape moving one
a bright eye following the light wood carried by the river
seeping between rocks a river begins nameless
tumbling wood at high tide into a river
river valley letting the sunrise into the sea
rain the river beginning on the roof
amber clouds in skies shallow with rain a moving stream
along with the rain going down the mountain to the sea
rivers converging raindrops
clean bright blue redwood shadows on a muddy river
wind in pines rushing to the river rain
clouds hanging around the river rain drop spirits
sunshine in the mud-yellow river rain
spring rain a dance with tiny steps tree roots growing
playfully tossing river smooth stones spring run-off
spring run-off leaping into the sky falls
spring run-off down the face of the rock jagged joy
escaping a moan from the banks spring run-off
sound from the lizard's voiceless throat dry leaves
among fallen leaves a voice from the neighbor's yard scraping cement
autumn mountain climbers one leaf falls
cloves of garlic arguing voices braided together
old-timers finding golden autumn most lovely
blown leaves turning the sunlight from green to gold
riversong wind blown from autumn trees a stream of gold
autumn leaves along with with sunset a blaze of glory
weeping rock in autumn dried leaves gold
low autumn sun rolling over red rocks golden trees
late rains high in a river tree autumn gold leaves
nearness of hills undulating in the garden tufts of heather
patchwork quilt the rumpled beds of heather
picking huckleberries afterwards the lessons in braille
huckleberries in her smile purple teeth
huckleberries in redwood shadows round and tart
mountain evening in a huckleberry sky the smell of pie
midnight air pounded seas a throbbing
tearing night wild surf rolls in morning light
wild surf on glistening wings harp rhythms
wild surf sea and earth singing air
snowfields whiteness at high tide the surf
snowy hill stretches the unbroken field curving it just a bit
wild seas footprints fill with foam
listening to sea waves the cup of tea also tastes cold
surface tension the smooth ocean a sacred mirror
snow-covered peaks covered with blackness obsidian fields
a peninsula the gulls carry their name from sea to sea
land's end pushing into the sea white water
the old pond how snugly it fits new ice
winter millpond the moon cuts wavelets in silver slivers
in time oars dipping into winter
upstream the solstice moon has frozen the river
sun shine in a drop of melting snow the river black
rocks frozen in snow a lonely woman stares at the river's cold
snow-capped rocks above the river's current nimbus
surf tongue a whispering roar in the river's mouth
each day anew river's mouth finds the sea
river mouth rushing to the sea curves a smile
sea lions bark their breath comes ashore as mist
into the sunny meadow shorn sheep covered with night cold
after the storm small waves on sea meadows meek sheep
days of the week sheep enter the fold of night
white waves splash on the hillside scattered sheep
sleeping late on the doorstep two slugs
waiting for rain the slow way slugs make love
a phi-based spiral unwinds a snail's slippery path
periwinkles signing secret names in wet sand
following a snake the river wiggles down canyon
squatters rights debated by the snake in the lettuce
nervous the thin weed touched by a snake
winding the road a snake into a flat tire
a twitter nest-building sparrows a passing shower
door chimes the spring spider moves eight legs
rainbows sunlight segmented by a spring spider
a day moon on glistening low-tide rocks golden starfish
lying on the beach arms spread - legs together a starfish
sailing to dream the dreams of starfish
curve of the sea fitting into the dome of sky starfish
starfish seeing blue sky for the first time
storks have returned suddenly this old barn roof brooding
whirlpools from earth to sky tree sap
deep in the woods the May month trillium deep in a dream
tulip fields the elegance of folk wearing wooden shoes
standing before a wide field of flowers one tulip
bright by the candle the tulips also are burning
picking wild flowers the early spring sun in my hand
wild flowers abandoned by the road a strange car
sea fragrance rising from the cliff breath of wild flowers
desert wild flower colors all rock
a meadow made by a violin wild flower notes
puffs of smoke logging trucks' exhaust among wild lilac
hillsides clouds in the bushes of wild lilac
lost on the mountain the smell of wild lilac sickening sweet
sunshine caught by wild mustard passed to the gorse
ancestors the wild plum blooms again
time unmeasured by willows swaying
water-dowsing the willows tremble in spring floods
slanted sunshine the river breaks and dapples beneath the willows
white laced waves tearing silk across the sand
each wave curves upward catches a gleam of sunlight then moves on
seas of silk shapes without scissors waves torn asunder
waves feeling time
a woman a step down a waterfall
taking to the waterfall the everyday worries washed away
mountain waterfall fog flows backwards into clouds
breath of angels air of waterfalls up one's nose
foot of the falls tourists stopped in their tracks
foot of the falls the roaring opens tourists' mouths
writing its name on a granite cliff water falls
quiet river all of the wind out of its falls
water drops a radiance in the falls
beyond the campfire darkness draws together the woods at night
a cup of coffee the cruise ship steams into another window
by the window a fireplace joins the lighthouse
vacation the first day without rain
seaside summer hearing the foghorn then nothing else
vacation house sitting on the porch gift-rapted
Indian cave shadows deep in cracks from other suns
pepper trees hot as hell at the mission
circling the mission a flutter of wings just pigeons?
jet age still in the ancient mission an offering of fire
church yard colors of fallen stones raised by flowers
mission church a roof of song in rows of starlings
at the shrine pine needles crisscross the holy spot
holy place sitting on sacred rocks itches
guests the only ones on time are the stars
sun through fog visiting children blow soap bubbles
kids discover spooky white in beach sand grandma's ankles
child finally sleeps stars come out singing a lullaby
sign palm reader open
Gypsy lips curve into a smile future revealed
all during supper the city boy sits on the tractor
how he inspects his fields the man with visitors from his wife's family
visiting how good to see her oven dirtier than mine
wolf moon slipping into northern pines winter
winter moonlight the crystal prism turns with the tides
surf and sea white with the sound of moonlight
mornings the winter moon leaves a frosted path
cold night I feed brownies to aching bones
knocking cold comes in unasked the night house
winter nights enough warmth to answer letters
night breaking waves rocks
silence in a dark night an ill-made shape
night the animal that keeps death in a little space prowls to the left
night overtaking the blackness of molten rock
longest night full moon whitens pure snow
Northern Lights a white robed choir sings to radio static
rattle of rain across the valley into my hand
downpour a basket on the porch fills with rain
raindrops inside heartbeats
after dinner so full of soup it begins to rain
to the rocks the sky falling free a bluish glow
pale skies winter comes from afar a white foam wave
paperback romances the eyes of a woman reading her own story
finger of darkness a forest of black shapes closes my book
whispers my ancestors turning to larva under the mounds
smoked glasses in oak wood frames faces
grandfather nods portraits on a farmhouse wall in a wobbly mirror
in a flash not letting him die a photograph
rest home knitting potholders for the kitchen she no longer has
laughter in nursing home halls peeling from the molding
gentle holes in clean underwear filling the sewing basket
snow and sunshine pulling cars with skis into mountains
bouncing from snow so young the sunshine on childish cheeks
streaks of sunshine sliding down the north slope laughing children
putting away the sled the frayed rope drags in the mud
snowbound digging out haiku
catching a chill the failure to photograph snowflakes
shoveling her snow the parakeet hops behind glass frost flowers
a chapped lip sound the neighbor shoveling snow on a brick path
an old woman the harshness of winter in her hands
casting snow from a bundle of twigs the first warmth
borrowing twigs his hand outstretched to the meager fire
cold gathers the sulphur spark against thin wood
sleeping your image in dreams awakens
in my dream you touch me awake
it's black the road that takes you from me
waiting for guests the corner of the rug keeps turning up
something's coming in winter's high-water marks a dry rustle
earth frozen dry leaves behind my wide cape thus I search for you
wet chalk it's been such a long time since you've written
grinding more ink the only thought that comes tender as the rain
the chalk of her pelvis beacons for a child's soul now draws a line
distant daughter hearing her coins drop into a telephone
driftwood hermitage cold and loneliness take up the pen
pages filled yet the stamp carries away unspoken words
sleeping alone the cold side of the bed
wild surf shaking the sunny beach our desire for spring
salt crusts thin skin on a blown beach this itching
dreams under the tent of the Burpee seed catalog winter gardens
eaves dripping the candle flame flickers
in the back of my brain a photo of your eyes watching my day
balanced at dawn a full moon slides into the sea without ripples
wild surf tears in the night a tender new moon
morning a touch of sea waves and the moon melts
sea light filling the valleys with mist
moving against mist crumbles from the cliff stream down
pink misty mountains gather between the peaks the rising sun
morning mist filling the spaces of night birds
lacking a redness the gray mist of morning not yet an argument
mists leaving the lake high
fire angels river mists at dawn manifest
ocean roar at the open window a breath of mist
mist softens the hills incoming waves
a wooden gate the sky begins to crumble the upright posts
narrow brook in pouring rain the smallness
rain falling in the brook once again
salt shaker in dawn's pearly light the pouring rain
in this rain my house a stone in the stream I a female fossil
March rains filling the zodiac with fish
running from the hill the haste of rain water in twisted paths
tops of waves on mountain ridges rain
rehearsing vows in the middle of the night frogs
honeymooners boats in the harbor anchored together
smiles leaving her bridal jitters at the altar
meeting an old friend at the mountain stream a bear
silence around lovers a silver cord
lovers in church giggling at the term immaculate
afternoon rain into my sleep your pencil moves
book covers renewing a friendship somewhat faded
clipboard unable to tell your poem from mine
daybreak the person you love is not perfect
without love sea kelp growing a holdfast
alone but not alone the sun - the moon
so easy to love yet she always fumbles locks and keys
organ drone mother's warning about choirboys
rain complaining of the steepness of the lane to his lover's house
parting at the river weeping willows
unwanted child wearing a name that doesn't fit
crying at dawn gulls and a lonely woman
morning fog dreams not buried deep enough
spring sunshine the strangeness of his perfectly normal thumbnail
sunny sea winds shoulders ache for the want of wings
kids laughing in the neighbor's house the childless couple
moonlight moving with the gate as the servant girl takes an evening
in the beginning before we awake there's the ocean
daylight leaping out of dark seas a wave
heaving seas at dawn you breath as lightly as the sky
refreshed by sleep morning seas calm and clear
the face of morning sky shining on the ocean a blush of pink
land breezes gentled by rolling hills to the sea
morning sun finding off shore rocks yet another one
waving every wave the ocean wild as early spring
surf sounds wall to the outer world pale green and white
the bay curving into the sea spring
wide ocean ending in little waves covers bare toes
dawn the moon with me sinks into the sea
morning coming from the night the flat ocean
underfoot the ocean rearranges its rocks
morning mild waves bring to the shore misty sunlight
undercurrents surf roar to Vivaldi on tape
spinning around the earth curls each row of waves
spring waves curled water coming unrolled
into the cove a big wave brings a bit of sun
gathering energy a wave rises up in me
weaver winds the white world of waves spinning
mountain spring a damp breathing from a rock
lips sucking from the spring a life sound
into autumn trees a rain-wet road winds sky colors
autumn hills a mountain of leaves down from maples
Vermont trip maples color the back roads of California
maples because they are admired most when their leaves are old
autumn colors in a redwood grove one maple afire
stone lantern dark before the flaming maple
looking closely under the mushroom a desert landscape
woman in the woods touching mushrooms touching the base
teary halos round the moon onion rings
cutting an onion all the halos fall in the soup
sun from the sea swept up the hills with pampas grass
pampas grass plumes the color calls from the west autumn winds
ribbons of moonlight glowing out of the earth pampas grass
salt in a cellar at seven the mirror frame a mottled pear
pears coloring themselves the days of summer
persimmons their roundness softens rice stubble
red-breasted birds among ripe persimmons hiding from the cold
fallen plums at the end of the dog's nose cold and wet
under dark earth dusty white potatoes the moon rises
grins harvested pumpkins
a redwood falls the air of heaven laid low
suspension bridge so narrow my shadow waits on shore
his days measured a river flowing across the sky
mouth open dangerous as the river ends in ocean waves
late leaves skidding over frozen snow yesterday's news
bright earth filling to the ceiling snow-cold
cushions on summer chairs snow
bright aura everything covered with snow
mountain air crystallized by snow and granite
snow-capped peaks on the desert floor white clouds of alkali dust
windowsill piled with snow far ridges
almost a mountain the hills grow up with snowdrifts
dark place in snow the bag of coal now white itself
cloud shadows the sky's footprints on mountain snow
cold night stacks on the woodpile a cover of snow
snowbound the lake also disappeared
snowbound fire spirits in a salt lake
snowbound all the colors quiet
heart of an agate slivered with polishing turns to the sun
home again fluttering in the eaves barn swallows
spotlessly clean the swallow's nest made of mud
from the broken bell the chatter of swallows nest building
dark barrel sun in the tadpole's mouth metamorphosing
on the same day tadpoles get their hind legs bulging eyes
clouds on the pond popped by kisses of tadpoles coming up for air
strange faces in wind-curved cypress termites
fresh picked a bouquet of flowers alive with ticks
pouring drops from pitcher to inkstone a thrush sings
rain falling the thrush pulls up a worm inch by inch
spring rains the willow strings raindrops
long hard rain hanging in the willows tender new leaves
spring high in the willows flood waters
wind murmuring as it spreads pollen the arched willow
nude beach the first ones out pussy willows
spring bare sun by winter's high waters willows laid low
water witching willow wands bend the river
willow shadows the length of a nap on the river bank
contrails pussy willows fluff in spring skies
moraine crevasses a line of willows winding the creek
river willow heavy drops on glistening wands
willow branches holding together raindrops
April storms green willow wands sweeping snow
spring rain young leaves the fragrance of moistened soil
sun cookies the kids ate them all up before the eclipse
company serving zucchini bread repeatedly
his relatives serving zucchini bread disguised as special
visiting relatives the narrow bed holds us together
an old album in the granddaughter's lap rose petals
summer guests taking it with them back to town
deserted road first the tourists leave and now the geese
three lizards together on the mountaintop - and we talked
creaking with the weight the noon-day sun heavy in wicker chairs
new cushions on the lawn chairs thick moonlight
wind moonlight in wind chimes still
in the zoo tiger lilies growing wild
a wild lion caged in his eyes small children
children's eyes in the snow leopard's cage touching his spots
blind smoke touching the sky with one finger
wood smoke pressed to the porch by low clouds
life of a snowflake falling
Mono Lake on salt-crystal pillars snowflakes
 silence snowing
satisfied with toast and cocoa it stops snowing
porch light brilliant with the points of falling snow
night light snow falls on the porch
rain silent snow
the clock ticks back and forth snowfall
first snow deep as a fallen leaf upright
mountain deep a sky covering with snow our way home
blue cold snow warmed by fallen leaves russet brown
ticking each hour snow deepens
early snow even in the hole is white overturned outhouse
the world wobbles the weight of snow drifting
no trespassing yet thru the split rail fence snow goes
to touch stars her outstretched hand fills with snowflakes
snowdrifts flinging moth wings across the land
striking a match dawn flashed in the oval mirror
cloud mountain sitting around the stove feet on the fender
above the wood stove the antique mirror reflects the warmth
sunsets in a much-used fireplace a scratched match
deep in the forest a blazing stove hearts beating
black wood stove the bright sounds of warmth
into the clearing wood smoke for pea soup
a rusty wood stove warmth spreads into the room star-shaped
silence a log breathing tongues of flame
the conversation between wood and the iron stove our few words
behind the stove the old clay demijohn of firewater
burned out remains of a cabin a fireplace
dark in dark then lighting logs in the fireplace
blazing logs gas flowers bloom red and orange
gas flowers warm a winter room blazing logs
embers darken the eastern sky a warm glow
heavy fog enclosing the hearth fire gray stones
silence warmed by a wood stove winter
runes cracks in hearth stones' messages
polished red eyes in the copper kettle firelight
worm holes in the blazing log warm again
blue on the postcard how far from the sea we both are
winter days a heart runs without panting to the beach
nothing in nature truly black my moods
breathing underlining sentences in a book
unknown keys in a box she takes a vow - no more love affairs
after the argument the sound of your eyelashes brushing the pillow
winter cold the sound of ocean waves between us in bed
tears not shed at your leaving a sinus drip
silence between your words anger
silence after something falls a coming apart
silence between words stories
silence before the answer truth
a lover's quarrel the seamstress tries to patch things up
asleep surrounded by things that don't
hard to believe the someone touching the roof is only rain
sun on a pine branch laughing shadow image a jackeral's face
 ghost stories beyond the fire circle
bear stories interrupted by the clatter of a garbage can
precipice the wind blows stronger my fear of falling
awakened by the hours of night an owl's dream
dreams turning on the light staying in the dark
nervous the whole house shakes in the wind
such a rain! changing into a clean nightgown
falling with the rain into bed
rain coming to the wakeful sleep sounds
waves wind flowing over mountains in rain
a sound falling in the night bird feathers spring rain
falling the amount of rain in a haiku
sky waters young between trees on a high wind
spring rain the night sound of bird feathers
after the storm a thing in the dark somewhere drips
rain clouds the tide turns small ripples
a rippled pool a rain cloud falling into the sea
round puddle in spaces between raindrops circles
edge of the roof raindrops dripping off seconds of the night
raindrops drowning in the pool rings as tombs
raindrops wetting rocks dried by low tide
spindrift the setting sun in a rainbow
segments morning rainbows in a wet net
clouds drifting into sea foam rainbows
unemployed carpenter l-o-v-e tattooed on his knuckles
Saturday rain the desire to buy something extravagant
Saturday rain desire by a warm stove for an affair
static electricity a silken sleeve is drawn to the amber
white surf wanting to keep the ocean free of oil wells
waterfall delicate forms for a spirit
buying Scotch magic tape as it were
dinosaur claws taken to a rocky beach a dreaming mind
ballet movies all night her dreams tip-toe
dreaming I was the sleeve of your coat I learned your secret
acrobat family mine - if I ran away to the circus
roar of the surf sleeping on the beach a child dreams
napping among driftwood logs sleeping
awakening furniture with chipped veneers
up and down driftwood lairs of lovers come and go
tide pool still as if it is tomorrow I'm not here
fading condolence cards the sting
sea spray a rock writes another name
spirals the world tied together with double helixes
a watch left out in the rain timeless
 three fingertips pressed to a cheek telling
 tide turns leaping white into the cove
rocky spring lips taking a sip from lips
taking from the spring words of praise holy water
many days of rain the ocean at high tide covers it all
tide turning around rocks around the sea
low tide a giant wave still fills the narrow gorge
a month of rain low tide returns to us a favorite beach
low-tide rocks resting on the ocean's bottom this morning
hearing secrets a low tide whispers about the rocks
pale green the ocean's bottom at low tide
low-tide rocks the sun in a rack of clouds far out at sea
deep enough the ocean covers a rock with small white waves
sea caves hollow at low tide buoy bells
whispers rising up to come ashore transparent waves
emerald pools the color of sleep at low tide
incoming tide wets small rocks each with time
pulled from sleep spring high tides crash and roar
magic light shining from rocks tide pool
opal light glancing from salt waves
land shaped by the heavy blue wind underwater
mountain stream sparkling waterfalls washed by snow
falling wind water catches sunlight in white plumes
water exploded from living rock falls
giant forest approaching night in the redwoods
without a step giant redwoods going up the mountain
redwood roots the base thickens enters the earth
redwoods her inheritance with wind in it
running up and down the tallest redwood only my eye
volcanic ash three and a half million years old saving the redwoods
redwoods cathedral darkening the apse a circle of trees
in a tower redwoods still growing shelter
among these redwoods growing old seems rather honorable
evening stretches over desert gold purple sage
Cathedral Canyon under Christ's picture wild sage
fire red without its flower the smoke tree
smoke trees rising to sound in high caves
braided rice straw I find a photo of your lover
in back of the school yellow leaves of sycamore an acid burn
tar weeds along the road covered with it
alone picking green tomatoes before the frost
sea oats bent by the north wind barely ripens
strange land hanging in mid-air I am as leaves in the larch
a quartz crystal light years ago keeping time
facing the sea weathered rocks of age wrinkled and gray
painted stones tree shadows not moving
bubbling out of the sea rock burned black a million years ago
soft round mounting a rock the sea leaves it jagged
curved straight a sea rock spreads white spray wing
silence of stones songs sung low and slow
unheated seas dark rocks dissolve into evening mists
high tide water covers rocks as sleep
waves breaking the ragged shore into sea rocks
white alone on a dark rock with small waves
crystal clear the rainbow colors of his shining
low winter sun lights a fire in a stone circle
wind echo in round rocks crystals
desert wash every sized crystal clear light
trees scattered in the soil petrified
massive rocks wind sounds pushed into the pines
shoreline rocks loosening the wind's roar from each wave
water dripping stories etched on rock howl in the wind
dragon jaw biting winds claw off-shore rocks
sun warms rock winter storms swept bare of frost flowers
rocks record players of time
melting snow your tracks leaving a dampness
melting snow the white nets hold down springing grasses
it melts last light of afternoon rest of the snow
cap of snow on the sun-warmed rock shrinking to fit
new-fallen snow scraped by wing tips leaving the earth
new-fallen snow screams of children biting cold
snow predicted a jar of old buttons in the top drawer
giant snowflakes bring to the window adult faces
crystals filling the night window with stars
glistening cold the stars bend down a few flakes
snow taste the cold fire of frozen stars
high winds stars moved about by swaying tress
cold stars dropping into the ocean snowflakes
winter stars pea soup doesn't taste without salt
the first stars a farmhouse and a buoy
before one star beams from the lighthouse search the sky
into the sky notes from the harp light stars
earth lines starpaths light the fluid landscape
in our blood bright crystals star journeys
waves in and out of the sea stars
curving the sky storm clouds arch into the bay
the winter tempest visiting the neighbors how still it is
winter storms passing the rain rattle drums on the roof
hearth stones around dark embers warmth
spirits forming fire into logs
quieter now flames subside in ashen sleep
rusty iron drawing flames above logs
punchline sparks from a log fire brighten the night
cliff side house inside ocean spray a fireplace
picture book flames from a curved log warm the heart
unfinished cabin insulated with bookshelves warm day and night
crash and burn the sound of surf in a fireplace
nights  something growing wood in the stove a flame
humming the started fire my chattering teeth
winter clearance sale the size of snowflakes coming down together
wild with fever dreams come wearing masks pale at dawn
my back to the floor walls become slatted trees wobbly with fever
sick in bed all day how the shape of the oak has entertained me
after the flu cups half-filled with tea very small steps
even when ill the day ends with evening
chewing cough drops a basket of nose-wet tissues spill to a sneeze
around the eaves the wind whistles into an earache
three minutes from here to eternity a phone call
flickering candle I'm not the only one who is scared
moving eyes objects reproduced a silence of mirrors
fog fear things so familiar they have no shadow
from where come ideas now when frogs are still as cold stars
last light glasses comes alive to watch out the night
at the airport in the town where I was born sinking into the mud
by a dormant tree someone is singing as the scythe rusts
grief hours alone lift our feet from the knowing
alive the dead go walking in my feet
mind wandering dragging a heart-spun net in heavy seas
a branch fallen to the roof downward and sloping
dead and this morning he'll never see
sea spray climbs sheer cliff on the beach without legs a man in a wheelchair
for her window Persian patterns of a rug wheelchair spokes
winter moon alone it journeys northward brightens my doorstep
her face a fold in fabric smiles
palest butterflies trapped in paper cages letters in winter
she saw reflected in the dampness of his eyes herself alone
gray painted the level landscape life as a photo
a white room its walls drawing in the energy patterns
rainbridge crossing the river rainbow
after a shower stars also shine brighter
May showers the wind so gentle rain is round
April showers your sticky diamonds dry on my leg
a white wave breaks in the death of tumult a rainbow
morning faces ocean and sky soften pink
 waves breaking a paler blue washes
line of mountains stretching the eye a clear sky
for the maiden dance light fluffy flakes of April snow
snow mixing my breath with spring
a morning moon nearly touching Venus with my finger
darkness dawn light enters filled with stars
faithful 'till sunrise of all the heavenly lights only the morning star
morning stars alone with me the beach
morning stars the call of the sea over the dunes
in the morning sun thousands of night stars still in the dew
still a few stars as if they will stay all morning
in the marrow of my own bones a morning star
forest clearing a circle of stars spinning out
sunshine making light of it salt water wave
opening the cave the morning sun slips in
 raindrops in a waterfall
 surf's surge and boom brushing my teeth
each white wave mounts the black rock differently
waves crash in the trickling away another crests
hour by hour the wave-white sea becomes the wind
spring run-off a little more - a little less humans get so excited
waist long-gone encircles a child
rented house the ocean's roar in mother's womb
the widow taking swimming lessons from the life guard
on a bridge a young couple discuss old lovers
nest the fullness of spring with eggs
lunch time by the brook spring-fed
always further down the road frogs and the dark
on the long pier a tall father tells his son how deep the ocean is
winds on the beach going inland to remind you of my love
thin and pale the air of spring leaving in flowers
tear-wet the tiny waterfall no one photographs
canyon walls slide into the valley water sounds
water smoke rising up the waterfall rainbows
a shower of light over the canyon rim a waterfall
river bed a sheet of water torn to mist
speed-rush a beach waterfall dives into the sea
mill race spring sunshine pushing the wheel
waterfall at the top of the hill Buddha
stone lantern a trickle of light in the waterfall
water falling the crystal parts of a rock fall
speckled rock drops from a waterfall blur
concave rock the convex bulge of the waterfall
leaves caught in cages of limbs escape
bent grass the shape of the apple tree in brown leaves
before falling dusty yellow leaves freshened by rain
leaves fall the air filled with church bells
fruitless vines going out of their way to repair the broken wicker chair
driftwood taking root in the river vines
autumn sun under willows a yellow leaf
old society dame a lifetime of faces studies the rock
long shadows stumbling over rocks on the way home
Death Valley oldest rocks on earth writer's block
pushing sunshine into dark seas slanted rocks
ancient river draws a white line in the tiniest stone
winter carves in mountain rocks deep shadow
centuries of stone your voice echoes forever
resting on a rock by a snow-melt stream winter-cold butt
low tide rocks bubbling out of the sea still lava
fog in the valleys cold hands
white winds from snowy peaks cover the valley
wide desert valleys push apart peaks soul bodies
winter shadow a low mountain fills the wide valley
icy streets today of all days his first steps
half-frozen ice how the idiot fixes his wayward feet
roads in winter stream
snow-clouds the cooled fires of volcanoes
passive an extinct volcano covered with snow
fire spirits making mountains out of volcanoes
volcanoes covered with pure clouds silent fires
jagged peaks swirling their fires into clouds
clouds swirling their fires into jagged peaks
sea storm blue black clouds sink salt-water air
after the snowstorm new paths to old places the skies clear
fire on water reflecting the sun after a storm
between winter storms a fisherman come to bring poems and primroses
after the snowstorm only wood smoke drifts into the clearing
snow storm brings white skies down to earth
this blizzard blowing about one small candle
snow storm children hanging in a tree paper flowers
storm winds in all things that don't die this quivering
winter storm tearing the waves white low-scudding clouds
storm winds breeze through a cracked window our nightly breath
storm waves winter tides wave to mountain tops
storm clouds forcing the sun to set far out to sea
night storm at sea dark things move closer
winter storms wrapping around the house the ocean's roar
storm sails cloud evening skies eyes
winter sun coming in late for breakfast
low winter sun covered with one wave leaping on the beach
low winter sun walking the length of the rock's shadow
mid-winter's day the sun and moon combine warmth
mid-winter's sun breaking the ice in a rain barrel
in her fevered brain the patterns in the quilt solid blocks of light
winter cold snowdrifts of damp tissues
coughing the sky fills with flakes of hard snow
for grandma with love at Christmas - the flu -
sickroom feeling the fake formica flooring
ears open the soul follows the pain
to smell a splinter long under the skin my little finger
rain predicted calling the doctor for an appointment
a confused brain unscrambling the diagnosis renal failure
at your side the huge bandage without comment
in the hospital your house slippers scuffed by our floors
after the injection you smile at my story and sleep
migraine sitting in a canyon on a split rock
recuperating all the electricity back in the lamp
care full folding  the new stitches into a chair
a fuzzy bicycle straddling my nose bifocals
new reading glasses a black blur crosses the threshold
a poultice on my shoulder dreams of haymaking
two days separated by the sameness a broken bone
cast in plaster throbbing
only the candle reads my poems wavers in the wind
in my chair listening to my music a stranger
silence so profound it takes the shape of your inner ear
isolated farms the white sky of snowdrifts outlining the cold
fog closing the brushwood gate silences ocean waves
leaving a book blind hands touch her own smile
window a filter of snow winter blind
stairs where no one speaks or rises
alone again with the wind in the pines somewhere else
gone - yet the space you left shines with light
alone building a fire for company
alone in the fire voices
a strange land saying I love you again
the wind dies the sound in one's own ears empty
enjoying life for all the dead the yet unborn
his face aglow the deaf child making signs
touching me during the ballet his left hand
winter madness parachuting to earth pale blue creatures dangle
 written in a dream all three lives
boxlike silence after the grandparents leave empty rooms
 a chalk drawing a piece of amber
in my ear hurtful blood sounds of the sea
your words the wind rubs the lake the wrong way
filling the bay an incoming tide of sunshine
silence in a rain shower sunshine
in spring sunshine around the granite stones spaces green
sunlight in a slurp of coffee Sunday morning
on the far ridge an arch of fire burns into Sunday
morning sun creeping from up to down in the sleeping holes
sunrise coming thru the mountain pass a yellow line
ocean sunrise the colors of a grandson running on the beach
sunrise slipping into view bird songs
the sun rises petting a yellow cat with warmth
walking east drawn to that place the sun rises
sun rise giving me a new name and a shadow
first day of spring on the calendar by the snowy window
rising from earth the spring equinox moon grows round
desert springs hot tub the canyon rim warms with spring's first dawn
spring equinox fitting into winter a saucer and cup
double helix earth hangs in a woven net
coming inside spring wind has filled my pockets with cold
wind rubbing the lake the wrong way
sea winds smells diluted by distance flow thin as light
lace curtains whipped by spring winds billows of clouds
cloud wind blowing colors in and out of the ocean
smooth seas upon jagged shores the power
a love affair building a fire in a strange stove
the new couple one looks upstream the other down
dropping sticks in the flooded river their fortune
rivers taking care of us small fishes
earth each spot layered with stories
sunshine on the hobo's back hitchhiking
song from a fence post meadow lark
the night is shortened by your letters on the pillow here beside me
coming together your nearness my music
the road before us departing clouds bright with a rising sun
so much rain this year how the kids have grown
turning green each wave crests higher than the last
thunder his first date not hers
spring rain your gentleness seems to know no sorrow
to off-shore rocks spring comes rowing lovers in a boat
parents showing the newborn to the rising sun
lips take from the springs whistling
cut crystal rainbow shining where he wanted to touch her
a brick wall splintered by frost back to the earth
orange winter windows beginning to dream night fears awaken
riverstone house water pushes snow drifts into walls
river-rock house at night the walls a babbling brook
city walls of no one sunless dark
noises the mossy parts of a waterfall
snow pond Yosemite spring time a waterfalling
falling into water smoke snow melt
rocks bending sound paths of the waterfall
from living rock the purity of snow waterrise
sunshine pouring down the canyon wall snow-melt waterfall
upward spiral wind pushed the waterfall into a cloud
sunshine carves the rock snow-melt waterfall
moving up in the falling rain our empty well
sunset stumbling over rocks shadows
sunset all the shadows home
sunset leaving to the wind bare rocks
sunsets blue clouds as land into pink seas
sunset all the shadows going home
night's warmth sucked into the sea a sinking sun
ocean sunset staying by the window 'till the color sinks
winter twilight gathers in her lap white folded hands
blue desert wind pushes the hills' shadow the long walk home
ocean twilight as final as the last one
alkali flats in the twilight of evening snow white
the rain-filled wind blowing away the word a damp newspaper
wind being massaged by wind chimes
from far at sea waves bring without wind that sound
winter wind a red flag waves to the whiteness
rock music the beach house shaken by howling winds
wind finding dark places in cliffs for the night
sea winds not believing in the silence
wind from the mouth of something dark
a blanket of wind wrapping around the house ocean cold
sea foam pulling storm winds across the beach
night winds touching crested waves with frost
wind tears smoke from the chimney snow flakes
blue tin cup the burn on a finger blistering
steady rain the dentist's drill turning to snow
snowing again a cold wind bites the newly capped tooth
junkie veins holding a heart above dark waters
pain a wound without shape cut-away skin
winter rain the cook eats alone in the dining room
roof a silent slice into the sky
broken shells the fishing boat pulled ashore for winter
closed shops a loose board bangs on the winter wind
well-tended gardens here lies the snow especially deep
blunt with ice the barge's bowsprit anchored fast
wind bothering the drapes of a closed window
battery cables giving winter's morning a jump start
home again my lacy white pillow ocean surf
unpainted porch sea fog comes to a closed door
clearing his throat the lawyer plays with the fob on his watch chain
light heart the pressure of writing with lead pencils
ashes of incense a page of poems hiding words
before the journey my last poems copied neatly
another tranquillizer the cat begins to purr more r's in the room
winter weaves a pile of pillows on a hard chair
comforter buttoned to the bed a curled-up cat
curving waves sleep carries away candlelight
packing arms of the flannel shirt holding on to peace
smoothed by seas a nearly round rock points homeward
home again raking in the Zen garden the oldest pattern
driftwood hermitage a well-chewed stick writes in the sand
too poor for a luxury house walking a deserted beach
his crooked face peering into a puddle for a dropped penny
silence marked down half-price the broken squeak toy
cloud-covered a departed soul sky-blue
wind still Grandma's afternoon nap lasts forever
the string cut in death feet go awry walking labyrinths
no! the grave is not the end we remember too much
twilight finding in an old album dad is still young
opening her closet secrets alive in the colors she has worn
snow pictures of other lands other lovers
winter colors passing in sleep dream zones
measuring the box once again inside
underground the Celtic cauldron a ringing bell
winter dreams lingering on long arms summer warmed
high winds memories of flight
stars bend down into the wind of whitecaps morning light
no trespassing sign torn down by spring winds the open sky road
a south wind ironing work shirts on the line at thirty knots an hour
warming her feelings of love the hot springs
ducks paddling around lovers
invisible thrusting the mountain raises all of us
flooded river rubbing low skies electric current
a woman's slit sliding over granite a spring
spring the urge to scratch the earth with a hoe
treasured gift her smooth stone calls as the phone rings
gentle breathing night rain comes alive tapping on the window
society dame flirts with an unreal cowboy her teenage romance
dawn's faint hour awakens under closed eyes a shiver of pictures
desiring you rain drums in my ears
love duet everyone in the music class crosses their legs
pearl buttons undoing her blouse two soft ones
patterns your words open the iris
tumbling surf water voices of children within the womb
heavy surf that sound I heard before being born
soft things inheriting a pattern in time
desert wind naked as the crack where I was born
silence baby's blue eyes without tears
fingerprints the tiny scars for life
lying in your lap the dense smell of musk a birthday gift
the poise of coming forward waves on a beach a baby's first steps
Aeolian harps rigged for sailing snowfields
tundra wind in an ancient poet's ears followers' footprints
snow lighting the way of the wind
across the sea wind blows to me stranger's snow
riding white roads before dawn without a steed winds of winter
crossing the bay from island to island winter winds
unseen wind water touching water with its roar
wind tangling bare air black trees
homeward wind pushes us across evening shadows
winter wind the smell of french fries and cold grease
circus time over now it begins to be winter
leaves gold shine holding bright the wall of winter
scrape of a spoon in the empty bowl end of winter
winter shadows poems written on the back of an electric bill
poetry covering holes in the wall with a wide brush
silence white paper unmarked
ink blot where haiku sleeps
smudging a page of poems ashes
sleep with the poem written down
poetry contest my name misspelled on the first line
rainy weather award propped on the table sticks to the sugar bowl
rainy day poems on the page water spots
pen moving in the dark black ink of clear images
a chain link fence writing renga in prison holds him together
beach poems written on driftwood with charcoal
rough paper snagging ideas in black
writing down a poem in that time-space the fire takes hold
morning's faint light seeing again the words in the sent letter
I touch myself with lacquered nails as you once did
memories stored in our muscles an iron will
without a shadow on bright days the hand I know
mailbox a frozen puddle overflows a rejection slip
ebb tide anger and rejection sucked out to sea
filled by the sea the stony places of hurting
all my anger singing with the vacuum cleaner
rows of holes edging the stamp of your last letter
after our words on the lace tablecloth cut flowers
data processing her letters from New York in winter
gutted candle if only I too could sleep
sea wind searching me for something someone I once was
desiring freedom her photos no longer capture views
misty red daybreak newly lit fires in the kitchen wish to be on a train
sweet cold incense in a winter room alone
treasure in a seashell serene colors a day alone
a roof of rain the sound inside solitude
silence after you've gone the widening world
silence when all alone a tunnel
a corner the shape of solitude chair and book
deaf child patterns of a Persian rug echoing
winter the hours melting into snowflakes
this need to love mountains give to spring flowers
downpour your fingers inside me
sun setting emerald waves free our passion
illuminated in the light from the barn their first kiss
rain pounding in love all night
rain on the roof wet around us on the sheets
kisses in your open mouth the rest of you
in and out of the river's mouth a tongue of sea
opening my legs to the flooded river currents meet
jerking off the love scene played by marionettes
deep humming waves unrolling the bay
relaxed cherry flowers unfold peace
across the fence with his cherry in bloom I can forgive him
planting peas a harvest today of peace
asleep morning seas quiet pink
raised up within the protection a mountain unfolding
a touch of silk caressing her body glistening sperm
vacation utterly exhausted by pleasure
local flirt two pair of wool socks below a backless dress
standing still his glance begins the dance
silence between eyes love lights
her hem the wind lifts a little fog
still awake on top of the comforter one feather
long damp beach winter solstice at ebb tide
walking in a fog a solitary person attended by angels
the shape of wind writing in dunes loneliness
alone in the house the flavor of peppermint cold on the tongue
a journey begins the way familiar to the door
frozen to his feet the length of a shadow wanting to sleep
alone in the room the gaudy television and me smiling
empty coffee cup the face looking at me gone
homeless man tied to his sleeping bag shoes going nowhere
art store sale the poet buys erasers at a discount
an old maid her favorite dancing dress yellows the attic
warm-breath wind words are helpless on parted lips
since birth unemployed the rich man and his navel
darkness welling up cold waters of the sea a sob
songs of sorrow the harp string breaks the fall of tears
laughter after the argument sounds like sobs
a blue wave on the crest an eyelid closed
deep sea green waters sheltered by a cove slipping into something frothy
rented house rows of ocean waves seem unfaithful
a strange house the new nightgown seems unfaithful
a young girl chewing gum in conversation with herself
river childhood banging a bucket boat sides
how proudly it waves the American flag T-shirt on her young breasts
wet dreams the man in the moon was once young
