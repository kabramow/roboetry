Run Driver class in driver folder to generate blackout haiku poems for three sample texts provided
1. American Fairy Tales by Frank Baum
2. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
3. Second Treatise of Government by John Locke

Haiku generator should work for any book written in English as a plain txt file in the Project Gutenberg library
If file has an issue - the system defaults to generating a poem from Rootabaga Stories instead

Due to the nature of our algorithm, it will take a second before each completed file opens in a new window

The Haiku class stores a haiku object
The search class contains our search algorithm and heuristics

The rest are objects or helper functions that have been separated for easier reading

Needs NLTK, Python 3.6
